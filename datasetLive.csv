"""He's not my enemy,"" Donald Trump said about the North Korean leader. (AFP)  Fox News' Sean Hannity asked President Donald Trump during an interview that aired Thursday why he walked away from an agreement with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.  The deal wasn't right, Trump explained, but added ""let's see what happens.""  He was optimistic about the future: ""Again, the relationship is very good,"" Trump said. ""He likes me. I like him.""  ""Some people say, oh, you shouldn't like him,"" he continued. ""I said, why shouldn't I like him? I like him. We get along great. We'll see what happens.""  Trump sees his interactions with world leaders like Kim in personal terms - Kim vs. Trump - instead of through the lens of his position.  For Kim to conflate himself with North Korea is fair: He's a dictator whose decisions and whims guide every detail within his country. Trump, though, is the elected leader of a democratic nation who serves as a representative of the public, not himself. His power is checked by Congress and the courts.  What Trump's doing, really, is approaching leadership of the country as he did his leadership of the Trump Organization. There he was dictator, enacting by decree whatever his heart desired. He embodied that company as Kim embodies North Korea. But now he has a new job.  We've heard language like this from Trump before. Last July, as he prepared for a summit in Helsinki with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Trump expressed optimism about the discussion.  ""Somebody was saying, 'Is he an enemy?' He's not my enemy,"" Trump said at a news conference. ""Is he a friend? No, I don't know him well enough. But the couple of times I've gotten to meet him, we get along very well.""  Putin is pretty obviously not America's friend, and most Americans view his country as a critical threat to the United States. So Putin may not be Trump's enemy, but most Americans think he's America's.  As unusual as this approach is for a president, it's even more remarkable that Trump would wonder aloud why he should be expected not to like Kim. This from a president who, during his first State of the Union address in 2018, said that ""no regime has oppressed its own citizens more totally or brutally than the cruel dictatorship in North Korea.""  ""Past experience has taught us that complacency and concessions only invite aggression and provocation,"" he continued. ""I will not repeat the mistakes of past administrations that got us into this dangerous position.""  He went on to cite the example of how American student Otto Warmbier was treated while imprisoned in the country on trumped-up charges.  ""After a shameful trial, the dictatorship sentenced Otto to 15 years of hard labor, before returning him to America last June - horribly injured and on the verge of death,"" Trump said. ""He passed away just days after his return.""  On Thursday, his tune was different. Kim ""felt badly"" about Warmbier's death, Trump insisted. ""He tells me that he didn't know about it, and I will take him at his word.""  Warmbier's parents disagree. ""Kim and his evil regime are responsible for the death of our son Otto,"" they said in a statement released on Friday. ""Kim and his evil regime are responsible for unimaginable cruelty and inhumanity. No excuse or lavish praise can change that.""  That cruelty extends well beyond Warmbier. After describing what happened to Warmbier in his State of the Union address, Trump told this story, about a man who was in the audience:  In 1996, [Ji] Seong-ho was a starving boy in North Korea. One day, he tried to steal coal from a railroad car to barter for a few scraps of food. In the process, he passed out on the train tracks, exhausted from hunger. He woke up as a train ran over his limbs. He then endured multiple amputations without anything to dull the pain. His brother and sister gave what little food they had to help him recover and ate dirt themselves - permanently stunting their own growth. Later, he was tortured by North Korean authorities after returning from a brief visit to China.  The North Korean government had between 80,000 and 120,000 people imprisoned in labor camps according to a 2014 U.N. report. But those numbers fluctuate a lot because ""[t]he inmate population has been gradually eliminated through deliberate starvation, forced labor, executions, torture, rape and the denial of reproductive rights enforced through punishment, forced abortion and infanticide,"" the report stated.  ""The commission estimates that hundreds of thousands of political prisoners have perished in these camps over the past five decades,"" it continued.  Those not actively in prison camps are in de facto ones, constrained by the country's borders. Kim's regime tightly controls the information his people can receive and they are expected to demonstrate fealty to the regime. Attempts to leave are often met with death. When a soldier defected across the DMZ in 2017, he was shot five times by other guards at the border but escaped.  All of this is overseen by Kim, who rose to power upon the death of his father in 2011. In order to consolidate that power, he had his uncle murdered by firing squad. He had his own half brother killed in dramatic fashion: In the middle of an airport in Malaysia, two women wiped his face with elements of VX nerve toxin. He died shortly afterward.  These are not likable qualities in general. They are particularly unlikable as demonstrations of the sort of governance that the United States generally lambastes.  On the campaign trail, Trump's frequent argument about Russia was that it was important the U.S. and Russia get along. That's come back to haunt him, but it's clear now that he meant it in the same way he does North Korea: If he and Kim can get along, who knows what can happen?  One thing that can happen, it seems, is that the president can wave away the behavior of a charming dictator even after criticizing it robustly himself.",https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/after-second-meeting-with-kim-jong-un-donald-trump-asks-why-shouldnt-i-like-him-2001699,02-03-2019,1:09:00+00:00
"Former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Mehbooba Mufti on Saturday termed the ban on Jamaat-e-Islami (JeI) an act of ""vengeance"" by the Centre, saying it would have ""dangerous consequences"".""There is an atmosphere of vengeance in the state, especially in the Valley after JeI youths and leaders were arrested. JeI is a social and political organisation. It is an ideology and I do not think you can imprison an ideology by arresting some activists of the outfit. We totally condemn it,"" Mehbooba told reporters at the PDP headquarters here.The PDP president said while there was no action against those persons responsible for incidents of lynching in the country, ""a social organisation involved in helping the poor"" in Kashmir has been banned.""You have Shiv Sena, Jan Sangh, RSS in the country who have lynched people on the basis of eating a type of meat, but there was no action. However, an organisation which has been helping the poor and running schools has been banned and its activists put in jails. We will not allow this. Its consequences will be dangerous,"" she said.Mehbooba asked the Centre not to turn Jammu and Kashmir into a prison. ""You cannot imprison an ideology, we live in a democratic nation and in a democracy, there is battle of ideas. If you have a better idea, let there be a battle on that, but do not turn J-K into a prison.""We had not allowed the BJP to do whatever it is doing now (during the PDP-BJP coalition), but unfortunately there is no one to stop them (now). When a Kashmiri is beaten, people applaud and become happy,"" she said.When asked about the sealing of properties of Jamaat leaders, including schools run by the organisation, the former chief minister said it was unfortunate and should not have been done.""It is unfortunate as these schools were providing education to the poorest of poor. Their students are meritorious. Where will all these students go after their schools have been banned. They are playing with our future and this is very wrong. They should rather ban (RSS) shakhas where swords are displayed. No Jamaati carries a sword,"" she said.Condemning the recent NIA raids on moderate Hurriyat Conference chairman Mirwaiz Umar Farooq's properties, Mehbooba said the Centre wants every Kashmiri to pay for ""a thought which is in his mind"".""I condemn the NIA raids on Mirwaiz. After all, he is the religious head of Jammu and Kashmir and has respect among the people. All these are acts of vengeance and it seems that they (Centre) want every Kashmiri to pay for a thought which is in his mind,"" she said.Later, party leaders and activists took out a protest march against the ban on Jamaat-e-Islami.

": Two days after the Indian Air Force displayed parts of an AMRAAM beyond visual range air-to-air missile as evidence to ""conclusively"" prove that Pakistan deployed US-manufactured F-16 fighter jets during an aerial raid targeting Indian military installations in Kashmir, the US has said that it is seeking more information on the same.“We are aware of these reports and are seeking more information,” a US embassy spokesperson told News18 when asked whether Pakistan had violated any laws in its use of American-made defence equipment in its air strikes on India.India’s display of the AMRAAM missile came a day after Pakistan claimed that no F-16 fighter jets were used and denied that one of its planes had been downed by the Indian Air Force.The central government has shared with the United States evidence of the fighter jet brought down by IAF pilot, Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman, in an aerial dogfight over the Line of Control on Wednesday to bolster its case about misuse of the fighter aircraft against India.According to Pentagon's Defense Security and Cooperation Agency (DSCA) F-16 jets were meant to be used to ""enhance Pakistan's ability to conduct counter-insurgency and counterterrorism operations"". Publicly available documents reveal that the US has imposed nearly a dozen restriction on Pakistan related to its use of F-16.Documents in the public domain shows that Pakistan was indeed sold the AMRAAM missiles, which can only be fired from an F-16, also bought by Pakistan from the US.IN 2016, the US Congress had written to the then Obama administration over the sale of F16s, saying that Pakistan’s behaviour had not changed and that it was not in anyone’s interest to further Pakistan’s defence capability considering its alleged complicity in terrorist activity. The sale, however, went through. Pakistan has been taking deliveries of the F-16s, now manufactured by Lockheed Martin, from the US since the early 80s.",https://www.news18.com/news/india/seeking-more-information-says-united-states-amid-reports-of-pakistan-attacking-india-with-american-missiles-2053393.html,02-03-2019,1:02:00+00:00

"NEW DELHI: The Samjhauta Express will leave for Pakistan from Delhi on Sunday after the two neighbours agreed to operationalise services at their ends, a senior railway official told PTI.The announcement came a day after Pakistan released Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman.The official said the first train from India will leave on March 3.While Pakistan had cancelled its services right after an air strike by the Indian Air Force , India cancelled the operations of the Samjhauta Express on February 28.The Railway Board in an order had said all operations of the Attari Special Express, Delhi-Attari-Delhi, which together with the Pakistani line from Wagah-Lahore is known as the Samjhauta or Friendship Express, will remain cancelled.It had also said that the cancellation was due to ""purely operational reasons"".Sources said after the missive about Pakistan's resumption of services was conveyed to the board, it was decided that services on the Indian end will resume too.The train will start running from the Indian side on Sunday, while on the Pakistan side it will leave Lahore on Monday for its return journey, the official said.On the Indian side the train runs from Delhi to Attari and from Lahore to Wagah on the Pakistan side.The Samjhauta Express, named after the Hindi word for ""agreement"", comprises six sleeper coaches and an AC 3-tier coach.The train service was started on July 22, 1976 under the Shimla Agreement that settled the 1971 war between the two nations.From Lahore, the train departs on Monday and Thursday.The train operates from Delhi on every Wednesday and Sunday.The sources said the footfall on the train, which generally records an occupancy of around 70 per cent, had fallen drastically post the Pulwama terror attack on February 14 carried out by Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammed in which 40 CRPF jawans were killed.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/samjhauta-express-services-restored-train-to-run-from-india-on-sunday-railways/articleshow/68231815.cms,02-03-2019,0:24:42+00:00
"UNITED NATIONS: The UN Security Council has designated Hamza bin Laden , the son of slain al-Qaida chief Osama bin Laden, under its sanctions list, describing the terrorist, thought to be based near the Pakistan-Afghanistan border, as the ""most probable successor"" of the group's current leader Aiman al-Zawahiri.The UN Security Council's 1267 ISIS and al-Qaida Sanctions Committee listed 29-year old Hamza bin Laden on Thursday, the day the US announced a reward of up to one million dollars for information about him.Saudi Arabia also announced on Friday it had revoked the citizenship of Hamza bin Laden via a royal decree in November.A Security Council press release said al-Zawahiri has announced that the Saudi Arabia-born Hamza bin Laden is an official member of al-Qaida. Hamza bin Laden “has called for followers of al-Qaida to commit terror attacks. Is seen as the most probable successor of al-Zawahiri,” the powerful 15-member Council said.The sanctions list subjected him to a travel ban, assets freeze and an arms embargo.An assets freeze under the Sanctions Committee requires that all states freeze without delay the funds and other financial assets or economic resources of designated individuals and entities.The travel ban entails preventing the entry into or transit by all states through their territories by designated individuals.Under the arms embargo, all states are required to prevent the direct or indirect supply, sale and transfer from their territories or by their nationals outside their territories, or using their flag vessels or aircraft, of arms and related materiel of all types, spare parts, and technical advice, assistance, or training related to military activities, to designated individuals and entities.Just hours before the UNSC Sanctions Committee designated Hamza bin Laden, the US State Department's Rewards for Justice Program announced a reward for up to $1 million for information leading to his identification or location in any country, saying he is emerging as a leader in the al-Qaida franchise.""Since at least August 2015, he has released audio and video messages on the Internet calling on his followers to launch attacks against the United States and its Western allies, and he has threatened attacks against the United States in revenge for the May 2011 killing of his father by US service members,” the State Department said.In January 2017, the State Department had listed Hamza bin Laden as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist, freezing all of his assets based in the United States or in the possession or control of US persons.

"Prime Minister Narendra Modi | Photo Credit: ANI  Amethi: Prime Minister Narendra Modi will address a public meeting and lay the foundation stone of an ordnance factory unit in Amethi, the parliamentary constituency of Congress president Rahul Gandhi, in Uttar Pradesh on Sunday. The constituency is being given a saffron hue ahead of the visit, during which the prime minister will launch several projects in the constituency which has remained loyal to the Gandhi family for long.  This would be Modi's first visit to Amethi after coming to power in 2014. He visited the neighbouring Rae Bareli constituency, represented in Lok Sabha by UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi, in December. According to official sources, Modi will address a public meeting in Kauhar area of Gauriganj and will launch some projects besides laying the foundation stone of a new unit of the Munshiganj Ordnance Factory, where assault rifles will be made in collaboration with Russia, on Sunday.  Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath visited Amethi earlier this week to review preparations for the prime minister's visit. Modi previously visited Amethi on May 5, 2014, and the BJP, which had fielded party leader Smriti Irani against Gandhi in 2014 general election, had managed three lakh votes.  Irani has been nurturing the constituency since and is expected to contest again in the coming poll, expected to be held in April-May. State BJP general secretary Govind Narain Shukla, who is the convenor of the prime minister's public meeting, said, ""It will be a historic meeting in Kauhar with over 1.25 lakh people likely to attend it.""  In 2017 Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections, the BJP had won four of the five assembly constituencies under Amethi Lok Sabha seat, with SP winning one. Congress had failed to open an account in the Gandhi bastion.  Meanwhile, Congress workers have objected to the white-washing of the wall paintings of their leader, Rahul Gandhi, near the meeting venue.  Gandhi's representative, Chandrakant Dubey, said white-washing the paintings of the local MP was ""very sad and unfortunate"" and only shows the intolerance of BJP leaders and workers.",https://www.timesnownews.com/india/article/pm-narendra-modi-to-address-public-meeting-in-amethi-on-sunday-his-first-visit-after-coming-to-power-in/375400,02-03-2019,9:47:33+00:00
"Lok Sabha elections 2019: Aam Aadmi Party announced candidates for the seats in Delhi  Highlights AAP announced candidates in Delhi for Lok Sabha elections Candidate for seventh and final seat, West Delhi, still being discussed BJP had won the seven Delhi seats in the 2014 election  The Arvind Kejriwal-led Aam Aadmi Party, days after declaring that there will be no grand alliance or ""mahagathbandhan"" with the Congress in Delhi, today announced its candidates in Delhi for the Lok Sabha elections, which are due by May.  The party will field Atishi from East Delhi, Raghav Chaddha from South Delhi, Pankaj Gupta from Chandni Chowk, Dilip Pandey from North East Delhi, Gugan Singh from North West Delhi and Brajesh Goel from the New Delhi Lok Sabha seat. The six candidates were earlier appointed as in charge on the respective Lok Sabha seats.  The candidate for the seventh and the final seat, West Delhi, is still being discussed and will be announced later, senior party leader Gopal Rai said at a press conference this afternoon.  The BJP had won the seven Delhi seats in the 2014 election. Since then, however, AAP has made its presence felt with impressive wins in assembly polls. ""We won 66 out of 77 seats in Assembly elections. We will try to make a similar presence felt during the Lok Sabha elections,"" Mr Rai said.  On why AAP did not tie-up with the Congress to take on the BJP and PM Modi, Gopal Rai pinned the blamed squarely on the Congress and its chief Rahul Gandhi.  ""Sheila Dikshit has said a straight no to alliance. Rahul Gandhi also said not possible... Aam Aadmi Party wanted the alliance, but the Congress is not ready"" Gopal Rai said.  At a public meeting last week, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal had said he was ""tired"" of trying to persuade the Congress to agree to an alliance with his AAP. A day later, Sheila Dikshit retorted, ""When did AAP ever come to us? If Arvind wants an alliance, then he should directly speak to me.""  Just weeks before that, Arvind Kejriwal and Rahul Gandhi both attended a meeting of opposition leaders at Maharashtra politician Sharad Pawar's home in Delhi. West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, who also participated in the discussions, told reporters that AAP and Congress had been urged to consider tying up in Delhi.  Mr Kejriwal's party was born out of the anti-corruption movement against the Congress over the demand of an anti-corruption body. In 2013, the Congress helped AAP take power in Delhi, but Mr Kejriwal quit after a 49-day stint over the anti-corruption Lokpal bill, adding to the acrimony. Two years later, AAP returned to power with a spectacular mandate and the Congress was wiped out. The Congress, say sources, believes AAP rode to power by eating into its vote-base.",https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/lok-sabha-elections-2019-aap-declares-candidates-for-6-seats-in-delhi-no-alliance-with-congress-2001638,02-03-2019,8:36:00+00:00

On Friday, Kumaraswamy, who was speaking at a party meeting in Mysuru, said that the BJP party workers, who were bursting crackers and celebrating the bombings, in India, were adding fuel to the fire and alienating the two communities within the country.

"NEW DELHI: Countering denials of the Pakistan government and military, Maulana Ammar, the younger brother of Jaish-e-Muhammed leader Masood Azhar , has in an audio confirmed that Indian fighter jets hit the JeM camp near Balakot in Khyber Pakhtunwa province of Pakistan.In a recording available on social media, the voice identified as Maulana Ammar decries the bombing of the “markaz” (a centre of religious learning) and expresses anguish over India striking a centre where jihad was being taught rather than the headquarters of an official agency.“Today the enemy has answered all questions itself when the enemy crossed the mountains and entered our land and launched attacks on our Islamic centre,” Maulana Ammar said, adding “This is declaration of war by the enemy.” The speech is understood to have been delivered a day after the air strikes at a gathering of clerics at Peshawar “The Indian aircraft did not attack any safe house of any agency. It did not bomb the headquarters of any agency. They bombed a centre where students were learning jihad for the assistance of Muslims of Kashmir,” he said. He is heard saying that the students were learning all about making the distress of Kashmir their own. “This is not a jihad of any agency, by coming out of its territory to attack us, India has ensured we start our jihad against it,” he said.The Pakistan establishment and sections of western media have raised doubts over whether the bombs did strike the target but the recording seems to suggest that Jaish leadership does acknowledge the hit.Other reports have also appeared stating that there was a sizeable toll at the Jaish complex at a hill feature called “Jaba top” that was hit by smart bombs released by IAF fighters. A report in FirstPost said locals confirmed that ambulances carried away some 30-odd bodies. A former ISI officer “Col Salim” is learnt to have died in the attack .",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/indian-jets-hit-school-of-jihad-says-azhars-brother-in-audio/articleshow/68238334.cms,02-03-2019,0:50:56+00:00
"NEW DELHI: The computer memories of Spice-2000 precision guided bombs were fed with satellite images and exact geographical coordinates of the major Jaish-e-Mohammed training camp at Balakot in Pakistan before being loaded on IAF Mirage-2000 fighters at Gwalior for the February 26 pre-dawn strikes.So, when the “clear to launch weapons” signals popped up on the computers of the Mirage-2000 fighters, which were then — depending on their altitude and angle of attack — around 2 km to 10 km across the Line of Control into Pakistan-Occupied-Kashmir, there was little chance of the 1,000-kg bombs missing their targets.“With their navigation\seeker systems, the fire-and-forget Spice-2000 bombs homed into the four to six targets selected within the JeM facility around 50 to 60 km away. The error margin was less than 3 metres,” said a top defence source on Saturday. The “before and after” images captured by the high-resolution synthetic aperture radars (SARs) mounted on “classified platforms” as well as Sukhoi-30MKI fighters, which were part of the “strike package”, show the designated targets were hit with precision, as reported by TOI on Saturday.Though an accurate assessment of casualties on the ground is virtually impossible, the Spice-2000 bombs armed with “digital scene-matching area correlators” penetrated the roofs of the pre-selected buildings in the terror facility, which would have “killed all the inmates in them with shock and blast waves”, said sources.Interestingly, the IAF also deployed “a decoy package” of fighters ostensibly headed towards the JeM headquarters in Bahawalpur in the Punjab province to lure Pakistani combat air patrols away from the actual “strike package” that had the Balakot facility in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province in its cross-hairs in the wee hours of February 26.

Pakistan was taken in by the decoy formation and vectored its fighters in the air towards it,” said another source.“Consequently, there was no Pakistani fighter anywhere near the actual strike package … the closest one would have been well over 150 km away. This also nails Pakistan’s claim that IAF fighters hastily dropped their bombs without achieving anything, much like its other factually incorrect statements like it did not use F-16s in the air intrusion on February 27,” he added.The IAF cross-border strike, and that too well inside Pakistan instead of restricting it to POK, has redrawn India’s self-imposed red-lines, which earlier held that any use of airpower would be a sharply escalatory step in the complicated dynamics between the two nuclear-armed neighbours. “If the IAF had been told not to cross the LoC, like it was directed during the 1999 Kargil conflict, the weapons package to be used would have been quite different,” said the source.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bombs-used-in-air-strikes-had-jaish-coordinates-fed-in-little-chance-of-their-missing-targets/articleshow/68238146.cms,02-03-2019,0:12:02+00:00

Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Saturday visited Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman at an armed forces medical facility in New Delhi and enquired about his health. She was accompanied by senior Indian Air Force (IAF) officials. The IAF pilot looked fine and sat straight in a chair during his interaction with the Defence Minister.  Abhinandan, who returned home on Friday after spending over two days in the custody of the Pakistani Army, is undergoing a thorough medical check-up at the hospital as his body had undergone stress due to ejection from his MiG-21 Bison aircraft after it was shot down by Pakistani firing on February 27.  Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had welcomed the returned of the Wing Commander on Twitter after he returned to India through the Wagah-Attari border at around 9.25 pm on Friday.  “Proud of you Wing Commander #AbhinandanVarthaman. The entire nation appreciates your valour and grit. You held your calm in the face of adversity. You are an inspiration to our youth. Salute. Vande Mataram,” she tweeted.  Dressed in a blue suit, Wing Commander Abhinandan was officially received by a delegation of officials of the Indian Air Force at the Wagah border amid high security. Air Vice Marshals Prabhakaran and RGK Kapoor were present to receive him. The pilot was whisked away in a convoy by Indian officials away from the public glare.  Addressing the media, Air Vice Marshal RGK Kapoor had on Friday stated that Wing Commander Abhinandan was released as per the standard operating procedures. He will be taken for a detailed medical check-up because he has ejected from an aircraft which puts a strain on the body.  Wing Commander Abhinandan was taken into custody by Pakistan on February 27 after his MiG 21 Bison aircraft was shot down in PoK. Pakistani fighters jets had invaded Indian airspace on Wednesday morning, with IAF aircraft including Wing Commander Abhinandan giving chase to Pakistani F-16s across the Line of Control (LoC). Media reports state that the Wing Commander had brought down PAF’s F-16 jet before his MiG-21 Bison aircraft received hits and was brought down. He was then apprehended by officials of the Pakistani Army on the same day and taken into custody.  A day later, Pakistan Prime Minister told the Pakistan National Assembly that Wing Commander Abhinandan will be released on Friday (March 1) as a ‘peace gesture and as a first step to open negotiations.’  After delaying his handover twice on Friday, Pakistan finally released the Wing Commander at 9.25 pm.",https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/defence-minister-nirmala-sitharaman-visits-wing-commander-abhinandan-hospital-97647,02-03-2019,1:51:46+00:00
"NEW DELHI: Countering denials of the Pakistan government and military, Maulana Ammar, the younger brother of Jaish-e-Muhammed leader Masood Azhar , has in an audio confirmed that Indian fighter jets hit the JeM camp near Balakot in Khyber Pakhtunwa province of Pakistan.In a recording available on social media, the voice identified as Maulana Ammar decries the bombing of the “markaz” (a centre of religious learning) and expresses anguish over India striking a centre where jihad was being taught rather than the headquarters of an official agency.“Today the enemy has answered all questions itself when the enemy crossed the mountains and entered our land and launched attacks on our Islamic centre,” Maulana Ammar said, adding “This is declaration of war by the enemy.” The speech is understood to have been delivered a day after the air strikes at a gathering of clerics at Peshawar “The Indian aircraft did not attack any safe house of any agency. It did not bomb the headquarters of any agency. They bombed a centre where students were learning jihad for the assistance of Muslims of Kashmir,” he said. He is heard saying that the students were learning all about making the distress of Kashmir their own. “This is not a jihad of any agency, by coming out of its territory to attack us, India has ensured we start our jihad against it,” he said.The Pakistan establishment and sections of western media have raised doubts over whether the bombs did strike the target but the recording seems to suggest that Jaish leadership does acknowledge the hit.Other reports have also appeared stating that there was a sizeable toll at the Jaish complex at a hill feature called “Jaba top” that was hit by smart bombs released by IAF fighters. A report in FirstPost said locals confirmed that ambulances carried away some 30-odd bodies.

"NEW DELHI: The computer memories of Spice-2000 precision guided bombs were fed with satellite images and exact geographical coordinates of the major Jaish-e-Mohammed training camp at Balakot in Pakistan before being loaded on IAF Mirage-2000 fighters at Gwalior for the February 26 pre-dawn strikes.So, when the “clear to launch weapons” signals popped up on the computers of the Mirage-2000 fighters, which were then — depending on their altitude and angle of attack — around 2 km to 10 km across the Line of Control into Pakistan-Occupied-Kashmir, there was little chance of the 1,000-kg bombs missing their targets.“With their navigation\seeker systems, the fire-and-forget Spice-2000 bombs homed into the four to six targets selected within the JeM facility around 50 to 60 km away. The error margin was less than 3 metres,” said a top defence source on Saturday. The “before and after” images captured by the high-resolution synthetic aperture radars (SARs) mounted on “classified platforms” as well as Sukhoi-30MKI fighters, which were part of the “strike package”, show the designated targets were hit with precision, as reported by TOI on Saturday.Though an accurate assessment of casualties on the ground is virtually impossible, the Spice-2000 bombs armed with “digital scene-matching area correlators” penetrated the roofs of the pre-selected buildings in the terror facility, which would have “killed all the inmates in them with shock and blast waves”, said sources.Interestingly, the IAF also deployed “a decoy package” of fighters ostensibly headed towards the JeM headquarters in Bahawalpur in the Punjab province to lure Pakistani combat air patrols away from the actual “strike package” that had the Balakot facility in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province in its cross-hairs in the wee hours of February 26.

"Sushma Swaraj had urged the OIC to ""act together"" to combat global terrorism.  Just a day after Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj addressed the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) as the guest of honour, calling out ""states which shelter terrorists"", India was strongly criticised in a resolution adopted by the influential grouping of 57 countries on Kashmir. In a sharply-worded statement on Saturday, the OIC hit out at what it called ""intensified Indian barbarities since July 2016"", ""Indian terrorism"" and ""illegal detentions and disappearances"" in Jammu and Kashmir.  In its first reaction to the resolution, India's Ministry of External Affairs said, ""Our stand is consistent and well known. We reaffirm that Jammu and Kashmir is an integral part of India and is a matter strictly internal to India.""  On Friday, Ms Swaraj had urged the OIC to ""act together"" to combat global terrorism amid heightened tensions between India and Pakistan triggered by the Pulwama terror attack last month. Though she did not name Pakistan in her 17-minute address, she said, ""If we want to save humanity, we must tell the states who provide shelter and funding to terrorists, to dismantle the infrastructure of the terrorist camps and stop providing funding shelter and funding to the terror organisations based in that country.""  She also said terrorism, which was destabilising regions and putting the world at great peril, was not against any religion. ""Terrorism and extremism bear different names and labels. It uses diverse causes. But in each case, it is driven by distortion of religion, and a misguided belief in its power to succeed. The fight against terrorism is not a confrontation against any religion,"" Ms Swaraj said.  On Saturday, the OIC adopted a resolution on Kashmir, attacking India for ""indiscriminate use of force against innocent Kashmiris"" and also praised Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan for sending back Indian Air Force pilot Abhinandan Varthaman, who was captured after an aerial encounter on Wednesday.  In response, Pakistan's Foreign Office said that the OIC meeting of foreign ministers had concluded with a resolution that ""supported"" Pakistan on the Kashmir issue.

"Donald Trump called on Congress to demand the transcript, given to publishers a short time ago  Donald Trump accused his former lawyer of perjury on Friday, saying Michael Cohen's scathing testimony to Congress this week contradicted a manuscript he wrote last year that complimented the US president.  ""Wow, just revealed that Michael Cohen wrote a 'love letter to Trump' manuscript for a new book that he was pushing,"" Trump tweeted Friday.  ""Book is exact opposite of his fake testimony, which now is a lie!""  The president called on Congress to demand the transcript, given to publishers a short time ago and yet to go on sale.  ""Michael Cohen's book manuscript shows that he committed perjury on a scale not seen before,"" Trump added.  Cohen, who worked for the president for a decade as his top ""fixer"" at the Trump Organization, assailed his ex-boss as ""a racist... a conman... a cheat"" in testimony Wednesday to the House Oversight Committee.  In a book proposal Cohen sent to publishers in early 2018 -- before he was sentenced to three years in prison, partly for crimes related to his work for Trump -- the attorney promised a glowing picture of the real estate billionaire.  The manuscript was entitled ""Trump Revolution: From the Tower to the White House, Understanding Donald J. Trump"" -- and according to the Daily Beast, it was aimed at offsetting books deeply critical of the president.  The proposal was pulled back after FBI agents raided Cohen's home and offices in April 2018 in an investigation probing the attorney's taxes and hush payments he arranged for women who claimed affairs with the president.  ""Some time in early 2018, Mr. Cohen was offered a substantial advance for a proposal regarding a book on understanding Donald Trump,"" Cohen's lawyer Lanny Davis said.  ""Mr. Cohen ultimately elected not to proceed.""  In the months after the raids, Cohen went from being a close ally of Trump to a foe, providing testimony in a plea deal with prosecutors that the president ordered him to make one hush payment and reimbursed him.  Trump scorned him as ""a rat.""  Cohen eventually pleaded guilty to felony charges of misuse of campaign funds in the hush payment, tax evasion and lying to Congress.  In five hours of testimony Wednesday, he compared employment with Trump to working for a ""mobster.""  Republican lawmakers however attacked Cohen as an unreliable witness, citing his earlier false testimony, and accused him of trying to cash in on his work for Trump with book and film deals.  Cohen said there were no deals in the works, but confirmed he had been approached and was open to the idea.",https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/donald-trump-accuses-ex-lawyer-michael-cohen-of-perjury-citing-unpublished-book-2001510,01-03-2019,3:03:00+00:00

"Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman | Photo Credit: IANS  New Delhi: Hours after Indian Air Force (IAF) Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman returned to the Indian side of the Wagah-Attari border Congress leader Salman Khurshid decided to take credit for the Wg Cdr s feat as a fighter pilot and his swagger while being in the enemy captivity.  Taking to his Twitter handle, the senior Congress leader tweeted: ""Many kudos for Wing Commander abhi Varthaman the face of India s resistance to enemy aggression.

The fearless pilot displayed exceptional courage after he was captured by the Pakistani army. The video in which he can be seen drinking tea while having a conversation with the Pakistan Army Captain went viral on social media and everyone lauded the Wg Cdr for his daring.  After Abhinandan s MiG 21 Bison was shot down he didn t lose his presence of mind and not only fought his captors but also swallowed the crucial documents related to the mission.

"Derek O'Brien accused Amit Shah and Prime Minister Narendra Modi of playing ""divisive politics""  The Trinamool Congress on Saturday accused BJP ministers of ""leaking exaggerated numbers"" to the media about the casualties in the air strike in Pakistan.  The Mamata Banerjee-led TMC also claimed that no statistics given by the central government can be taken ""seriously"".  Security forces have not officially attributed any number to those eliminated in the strike, Trinamool Congress national spokesperson Derek O'Brien posted on Twitter.  ""IAF has been very consistent: ""No number"". So why did a BJP mantri or two leak exaggerated numbers? And Delhi media fell for the numbers. Can one take any statistics this govt gives out seriously? Journos? Or slaves to propaganda aka sources?,"" he tweeted along with screenshots of TV news reports quoting sources as saying 200-300 Jaish-e-Mohammed terrorists were eliminated in the strike.  Later in a statement, O'Brien accused BJP president Amit Shah and Prime Minister Narendra Modi of playing ""divisive politics"" over the issue.  ""Look who has the gall to talk about ''vote bank politics''! Amit Shah and the BJP are the nastiest proponents of divisive and hatred politics.  ""We will not listen to his lectures on patriotism. Our armed forces belong to India, not to Modi-Shah-BJP,"" he said.  The comments from the TMC leader came a day after party chief and West Bengal Chief Minister Ms Banerjee demanded proof from the government of the impact of the strike on a JeM camp across the border.

"Sushma Swaraj had urged the OIC to ""act together"" to combat global terrorism.  Just a day after Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj addressed the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) as the guest of honour, calling out ""states which shelter terrorists"", India was strongly criticised in a resolution adopted by the influential grouping of 57 countries on Kashmir. In a sharply-worded statement on Saturday, the OIC hit out at what it called ""intensified Indian barbarities since July 2016"", ""Indian terrorism"" and ""illegal detentions and disappearances"" in Jammu and Kashmir.  In its first reaction to the resolution, India's Ministry of External Affairs said, ""Our stand is consistent and well known. We reaffirm that Jammu and Kashmir is an integral part of India and is a matter strictly internal to India.""  On Friday, Ms Swaraj had urged the OIC to ""act together"" to combat global terrorism amid heightened tensions between India and Pakistan triggered by the Pulwama terror attack last month. Though she did not name Pakistan in her 17-minute address, she said, ""If we want to save humanity, we must tell the states who provide shelter and funding to terrorists, to dismantle the infrastructure of the terrorist camps and stop providing funding shelter and funding to the terror organisations based in that country.""  She also said terrorism, which was destabilising regions and putting the world at great peril, was not against any religion. ""Terrorism and extremism bear different names and labels. It uses diverse causes. But in each case, it is driven by distortion of religion, and a misguided belief in its power to succeed. The fight against terrorism is not a confrontation against any religion,"" Ms Swaraj said.  On Saturday, the OIC adopted a resolution on Kashmir, attacking India for ""indiscriminate use of force against innocent Kashmiris"" and also praised Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan for sending back Indian Air Force pilot Abhinandan Varthaman, who was captured after an aerial encounter on Wednesday.  In response, Pakistan's Foreign Office said that the OIC meeting of foreign ministers had concluded with a resolution that ""supported"" Pakistan on the Kashmir issue.  Pakistan's Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi had skipped the meeting of foreign ministers because the OIC had invited Ms Swaraj to the event, sending junior officials to ""represent the country's interests"".  It was for the first time that India has been invited to an OIC meeting as guest of honour. Pakistan, a member of the OIC, tried to get Ms Swaraj ''disinvited'' from the Abu Dhabi meet following India's air strike on a terror camp in Pakistan but its request was turned down.",https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/day-after-sushma-swaraj-speech-islamic-nations-oic-slam-india-on-kashmir-2001785,02-03-2019,8:05:00+00:00

"Donald Trump called on Congress to demand the transcript, given to publishers a short time ago  Donald Trump accused his former lawyer of perjury on Friday, saying Michael Cohen's scathing testimony to Congress this week contradicted a manuscript he wrote last year that complimented the US president.  ""Wow, just revealed that Michael Cohen wrote a 'love letter to Trump' manuscript for a new book that he was pushing,"" Trump tweeted Friday.  ""Book is exact opposite of his fake testimony, which now is a lie!""  The president called on Congress to demand the transcript, given to publishers a short time ago and yet to go on sale.  ""Michael Cohen's book manuscript shows that he committed perjury on a scale not seen before,"" Trump added.  Cohen, who worked for the president for a decade as his top ""fixer"" at the Trump Organization, assailed his ex-boss as ""a racist... a conman... a cheat"" in testimony Wednesday to the House Oversight Committee.  In a book proposal Cohen sent to publishers in early 2018 -- before he was sentenced to three years in prison, partly for crimes related to his work for Trump -- the attorney promised a glowing picture of the real estate billionaire.  The manuscript was entitled ""Trump Revolution: From the Tower to the White House, Understanding Donald J. Trump"" -- and according to the Daily Beast, it was aimed at offsetting books deeply critical of the president.  The proposal was pulled back after FBI agents raided Cohen's home and offices in April 2018 in an investigation probing the attorney's taxes and hush payments he arranged for women who claimed affairs with the president.  ""Some time in early 2018, Mr. Cohen was offered a substantial advance for a proposal regarding a book on understanding Donald Trump,"" Cohen's lawyer Lanny Davis said.  ""Mr. Cohen ultimately elected not to proceed.""  In the months after the raids, Cohen went from being a close ally of Trump to a foe, providing testimony in a plea deal with prosecutors that the president ordered him to make one hush payment and reimbursed him.  Trump scorned him as ""a rat.""  Cohen eventually pleaded guilty to felony charges of misuse of campaign funds in the hush payment, tax evasion and lying to Congress.  In five hours of testimony Wednesday, he compared employment with Trump to working for a ""mobster.""  Republican lawmakers however attacked Cohen as an unreliable witness, citing his earlier false testimony, and accused him of trying to cash in on his work for Trump with book and film deals.  Cohen said there were no deals in the works, but confirmed he had been approached and was open to the idea.",https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/donald-trump-accuses-ex-lawyer-michael-cohen-of-perjury-citing-unpublished-book-2001510,01-03-2019,3:03:00+00:00
