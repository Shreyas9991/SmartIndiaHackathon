4,"24th February 2010: When Sachin Tendulkar rewrote history books in GwaliorSachin Tendulkar is widely regarded as one of the best batsmen in the history of the game and on this day, nine years ago, the Indian superstar etched his name in history books against South Africa in Gwalior.Tendulkar became the first cricketer ever to score a double century in ODIs as he powered the hosts to a series-clinching win over the Proteas at the Captain Roop Singh Stadium.Riding on Tendulkar’s unbeaten 200, India put on a huge total of 401/3 in 50 overs. Depite AB De Villiers’101 ball 114, the visitors were dismissed for just 248 and they fell short by 153 runs.The Master Blaster’s innings included 25 boundaries and three massive sixes and he crossed the 200-run mark off just 147 deliveries at a healthy strike rate of 136.0.Tendulkar was rightly adjudged the man of the match as he showed the way to other that crossing the 200-run mark in ODIs was possible. Following Tendulkar’s heroics, many others took the leaf out of his book and went on to smash double centuries in the 50-over format of the game.India has most representation in this exclusive club as current vice-captain Rohit Sharma has done it thrice during the course of his illustrious career. Rohit’s 264 against Sri Lanka in Kolkata in 2014 also remains the highest individual score in ODIs.Apart from Tendulkar and Rohit, Virender Sehwag is the third Indian on this elite list as he smashed 219 against Windies in Indore in 2011.The other such cricketers are New Zealand’s Martin Guptill (237* vs WI), West Indies’ Chris Gayle (215 vs ZIM) and Pakistan’s Fakhar Zaman (210* vs ZIM).",0
5,"3 from same family die after car rolls into ditch in Uttarakhand“There were seven people of the same family hailing from Chourkhanda village of Pauri. They had gone to Delhi in the rented vehicle for a family function.

Arvind was the head of the village.They were returning from a family function in Delhi, when the accident took place near Kotdwar town at around 5:30am, State Disaster Response Force officials said. SDRF official Praveen Alok said there were eight people, including the driver, in the vehicle.“There were seven people of the same family hailing from Chourkhanda village of Pauri.

6,"7/11 train blasts: 11 years on, safety still a big concernDespite railway stations being on the radar of terrorists and train commuters been targeted twice during the July 2006 train bombings and the Mumbai terror attacks of November 2008, the stations still continue to have unhindered access via several unauthorised entry-exit points, according to railway police officials. The Government Railway Police (GRP) along with their counterparts at the Railway Protection Force (RPF) recently conducted a security audit of the stations, which revealed that there are at least 1090 unsecured spots between CSTM-Thane-Panvel and Churchgate-Bandra that need quick attention, according to Niket Kaushik, Commissioner, Government Railway Police (GRP).   Owing to heavy and uncontrolled footfall at the railway stations, the ‘minimum standard security’ apparatus continues to be compromised as all the stations have unauthorised entry and exit points. This makes all the stations unsafe and the railways have been informed to plug them, however, very little has been done.  The highest number of vulnerable points, 315, was found in Vashi GRP’s Thane-Vashi trans-harbour line, which is last on the list of security. “The audit is still underway and is being conducted by all the 17 police stations in Mumbai’s suburban section. The data will help to analyse the loopholes and improved coordination among the agencies and police. The concerned agencies (railways and BMC) are being informed about the findings for improving things on ground,” said Niket Kaushik, GRP commissioner.",1
7,"‘Denuclearization’: Donald Trump teases ahead of talks with Kim Jong-unDay before leaving for the upcoming Hanoi summit, President Donald Trump teased the prospect of denuclearization as an outcome with a question mark and said Chairman Kim Jong-un is aware North Korea could become one of the “great economic powers” if it gave up its nuclear weapons.Denuclearization of the Korean peninsula — getting rid of North Korea’s nuclear weapons, essentially — is the chief US goal but the two sides remain far apart on it and President Trump is under pressure to show progress on one of his administration’s signature foreign policy initiative amidst criticism that he has been played so far by the younger Chairman Kim.“I don’t know if North Korea has made the choice to denuclearize,” a senior administration official said last week, previewing summit.Trump leaves for Hanoi, Vietnam Monday morning and will Kim, who is already on his way by train, on Wednesday and Thursday. US and North Korean negotiators have reached in advance and hammering out outcomes, if any, that could include the two countries exchanging liaison offices.Trump and Kim will hold multiple meetings, following the Singapore template from last summer, their first summit — a one-on-one, then one with their officials and a lunch, US officials have said.“We both expect a continuation of the progress made at first Summit in Singapore,” Trump wrote on Twitter Sunday.“Denuclearization?” he ended that post with a question mark.Also read | ‘Very, very bad situation between India and Pakistan’: Trump on Pulwama attackBut did not provide an answer. He went on, instead, reprise for North Korea the prospect of economic prosperity in exchange for giving up its nuclear weapons programme: “Chairman Kim realizes, perhaps better than anyone else, that without nuclear weapons, his country could fast become one of the great economic powers anywhere in the World. Because of its location and people (and him), it has more potential for rapid growth than any other nation!”Complete and verifiable denuclearization by North Korea is the key US goal but experts and US intelligence officials insist Pyongyang has not even made a start yet, though they agree it has also not conducted nuclear and missile tests since the two sides began talking earlier 2018, leading up to the June summit.North Korea is seeking, in return, a peace treaty to formally end the Korean war to replace the 1953 armistice, lifting of economic sanctions, and security guarantees. Kim hasn’t managed any of that yet yet, but his June meeting with Trump has given him a leg up over his father and grandfather, who ruled the country before him, as the first North Korean leader to meet a sitting American president.",0
8,"‘Missing man’ formation marks tribute to IAF pilot Sahil GandhiA Rafale aircraft of the French air force also made a low pass during the flying display as a mark of respect to Gandhi, who hailed from Haryana’s Hisar. A radio call given by the French pilot announcing this was broadcast over the PA system on the ground.French aircraft Rafale manoeuvres during the inauguration of the 12th edition of AERO India 2019 air show at Yelahanka airbase in Bengaluru on Wednesday. (PTI Photo)The Indian Air Force (IAF) on Wednesday conducted a memorial fly-past at the Yelahanka air base for Wing Commander Sahil Gandhi, a day after the fighter pilot was killed in a mid-air collision between two British-origin Hawk advanced jet trainers while practising aerobatic manoeuvres for the five-day Aero India-2019.Three IAF fighter jets — a Sukhoi-30 fighter flanked by a Jaguar and a Tejas light combat aircraft — flew the time-honoured “missing man” formation to honour Gandhi at the inaugural fly-past of Asia’s biggest air show.“The formation pays tribute to the fallen pilot. If he was alive, he would have been flying too in the finger four formation,” said former IAF chief Air Chief Marshal Fali Major.Gandhi, 37, was part of the IAF’s renowned Surya Kiran Aerobatic Team (SKAT), which consists of the country’s finest pilots trained to perform complex stunts. Two other pilots injured in the twin Hawk crash - Wing Commander VT Shelke and Squadron Leader TJ Singh - are recuperating in an IAF hospital.A Rafale aircraft of the French air force also made a low pass during the flying display as a mark of respect to Gandhi, who hailed from Haryana’s Hisar. A radio call given by the French pilot announcing this was broadcast over the PA system on the ground. Captain Nativel Babouc, who flew the Rafale in a low pass to honour Gandhi, said, “It was my way to pay homage to the fallen pilot. We fighter pilots are one big family no matter which country we come from.”IAF chief Air Chief Marshal BS Dhanoa said it was too early to say what went wrong and only an investigation would reveal the cause of the accident. The jets were in a mirror manoeuvre – one flying inverted above the other – seconds before the collision that has become the major talking point at the 12th edition of the air show. While SKAT is not taking part in the air show any longer because IAF wants to pinpoint the reasons for the accident, the display team’s Hawks were seen parked outside an apron near the main runway of the air base.Defence minister Nirmala Sitharaman declared the air show open, asserting that it intended to put India on the global map as “a runway to a billion opportunities”.The IAF’s Sarang helicopter display team performed a string of breathtaking manoeuvres amid cheers and applause from the spectators, including ministers from foreign countries, and top military officials including the three service chiefs.Another highlight of the biennial show was a fly-by performed by a B-52 Stratofortress bomber that came from the Andersen Air Force Base in Guam.Of the seven fighter jets competing for an Indian programme to build 114 planes locally under the strategic partnership (SP) model, only Rafales, F-18s and F-16s were part of the flying display.",0
9,"‘Prime time minister continued shooting for film after Pulwama attack’: Rahul Gandhi attacks PM Narendra ModiIn a scathing attack on Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Congress president Rahul Gandhi on Friday said the “prime time minister” continued shooting for a film till even three hours after news of the Pulwama terror strike came in.There was an ocean of pain in the country’s hearts and in the homes of martyrs and he was smiling and doing a photoshoot in the waters, Gandhi said on Twitter with the hashtag ‘PhotoShootSarkar’.“Even after three hours of the news of the 40 jawans being martyred in the Pulwama terror strike, the prime time minister continued with a film shooting,” the Congress president tweeted in Hindi. On Thursday, the Congress cited media reports to allege that Modi continued shooting for a film in the Corbett National Park on February 14 for “self propagation”, and stayed put till the evening despite the attack on a CRPF convoy in south Kashmir’s Pulwama district in the afternoon that day.Congress’ chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala, addressing a press conference, also claimed the prime minister continued to “have tea and samosas at seven o’clock in a PWD guest house when every single Indian household didn’t eat food (that day)”.",0
10,"‘Sabka vinaash’: Yogi Adityanath’s take on SP, BSP, and Congress in UPUttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath has said while the BJP’s motto was “Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas”, the opposition SP, BSP and the Congress in the state stood for “Sabka Vinaash” (destruction of everyone).His comments came when a discussion on the budget was underway at the Uttar Pradesh Legislative Assembly.“SABKA stands for SP (Samajwadi Party), BSP (Bahujan Samaj Party) and Congress. Our Sabka slogan speaks about development of all. Their Sabka speaks about destruction of everyone...We stand for Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikaas. Yours is Sabka Saath, Sabka Vinaash,” Adityanath said intervening the discussion.Taking a dig at the Congress, he said, “Every citizen of this country is proud of our traditions. If the Congress had tried to take pride in the country’s traditions, it would not have come to its lowest tally in the state and the country. This situation has come as the Congress had insulted the culture and traditions of the country.” “When you want to garner votes, you show your janeu (sacred threads worn by Hindus). People have even started telling their ‘Gotra’ (sub-caste)... And even the SP did not find the Congress suitable to include it in the SP-BSP alliance,” the chief minister said, targeting the opposition Congress in the state.Adityanath also took a jibe at Ram Gobind Chaudhary (SP), the Leader of Opposition in the UP Assembly. “If you (Ram Gobind Chaudhary) had even an iota of sympathy for the poor, you would have been with Shivpal Yadav’s political party and not with the SP. (Ram Manohar) Lohiaji had spoken about socialism, which is not seen in your party (SP). In reality, it is Shivpal Yadav who takes the name of Lohiaji. You (SP) people do not take his name,” he said.He briefed the House on the various aspects of the budget and spoke at length on the various schemes of the state government pertaining to women, girls, farmers, labourers, youth, villages, electricity, roads, Metro rail, development of airports, health and education.“In a nutshell, I can say that this is a holistic budget. This is a budget which has taken care of the interests of all sections of the society and has given a new impetus to development. This is a budget which has brought smile and prosperity on every face,” Adityanath said.He announced that the state government will soon enhance the honorarium of Anganwadi and ASHA workers, those in the Panchayati Raj Department, village sevaks and cooks who make mid-day meals.Speaking on the recent terror attack in Pulwama that claimed the lives of 40 CRPF personnel, Adityanath said, “The anger which is visible after the Pulwama terror attack is an eye-opener for the public representatives. If a person indulges in appeasement of self-interest, and encourages terrorism, then the same anger will be visible which is today seen on the streets.”The UP chief minister said the BJP government has worked hard to put the derailed system of the state back on track.“UP, which was languishing among the bottom states of the country during the governments of the SP and the BSP, is now on the path of becoming the number one,” Adityanath said.",0
11,"‘We do not want to be an elitist company’, Apple COO on concerns over iPhone pricesApple has already begun reducing the price of the iPhone for third-party distributors in China and may follow the same in India where the iPhone is considered very expensive.Apple does not want to be known as an elitist company any more owing to the high iPhones costs and wants to become a brand accessible to all, company COO Jeff Williams has said.Apple has already begun reducing the price of the iPhone for third-party distributors in China and may follow the same in India where the iPhone is considered very expensive.Delivering a speech at Elon University in North Carolina, Williams said he is “aware of iPhone, Mac price concerns”.“It’s something we’re very aware of. We do not want to be an elitist company. That’s not -- we want to be an egalitarian company and we’ve got a lot of work going on in developing markets,” Williams was quoted as saying in a Burlington Times News report late on Sunday.During his speech, Williams discussed several topics, including the rising cost of the Apple products and inaccuracy of analyst cost estimates.“The stories that come out about the cost of our products (have been) the bane of my existence from the beginning of time, including our early days.“Analysts don’t really understand the cost of what we do and how much care we put into making our products,” he told students.Citing Apple Watch as an example, the tech giant COO said the company “built an entire physiology lab with 40 licensed nurses and enlisted the help of 10,000 participants to further study how calories are burned in various fitness exercises”.According to Apple CEO Tim Cook, there are several factors why iPhone sales are not picking up in the emerging markets.“The customers are holding on to their older iPhones a bit longer than in the past. When you pair this with the macroeconomic factors, particularly in emerging markets, it resulted in iPhone revenue that was down 15 per cent from last year,” Cook told analysts recently.Analysts say they expect some kind of price correction going forward as Apple has given indications that they will look at pricing outside the US closely now.",0
12,"Afghanistan smash world record as Hazratullah Zazai demolishes Ireland bowlersHazratullah Zazai smashed the ball to every corner of the ground, and even out of the stadium, as Afghanistan racked up a world record T20 score of 278-3 in a crushing demolition of Ireland on Saturday.The 20-year-old Zazai’s unbeaten 162 included 16 sixes and 11 fours, delighting Afghan fans in the Indian city of Dehradun.His haul of sixes was another record, as was his stand of 236 with fellow opener Usman Ghani and the 22 sixes scored in all by Afganistan’s players.Ireland captain Paul Stirling also hit a six off the first ball of his side’s innings as they chased a mammoth 13.95 runs an over to keep up.But they ended on 194-6 and Afghanistan won by 84 runs to wrap up the three match series with a game to spare.“It was a pretty disappointing night,” said Stirling. “We need to regroup now.”The night of cricket fireworks belonged to Afghanistan -- who overtook Australia’s 260-3 against Sri Lanka in 2016 -- and Zazai, who plundered his giant innings off just 62 balls.“I just wanted to play my natural game and today was my day,” he said. “The wicket was good for batting.”- Sixes galore -After managing just seven runs from their first two overs, Zazai and Ghani flailed the Irish bowlers, who from then barely managed an over without conceding a six.Zazai made his century off just 42 balls -- the second quickest in T20 internationals -- completed with the ninth six of his innings. Four of the sixes came off Kevin O’Brien in the 17th over which reaped 28 runs in all.One giant hit off Shane Gelkate went over the stands and out of the ground.Zazai’s stocks have risen dramatically despite missing a place in the Indian Premier League this season.In October, he became only the third batsman to hit six sixes in a T20 over for his Afghanistan Premier League side Kabul Zwanan.He equalled the record for the fastest T20 half century in 12 balls in the same match.Stirling hardly knew who to throw into the breach as a bowler.Boyd Rankin finally claimed a wicket for the Irish when Ghani -- who made 73 off 43 balls -- played a careless shot over long-on that Joshua Little caught diving as he ran in from the boundary.While Stirling and Kevin O’Brien were no slouches, they never kept up with the mountainous run rate, which had risen to 17 by the 10th over.Afghanistan’s star bowler Rashid Khan came on for the 11th over and was furious when captain Asghar Afghan spilled a relatively simple catch off his first ball to give O’Brien a chance with Ireland on 109.O’Brien was bowled in the next over by Fareed Ahmad for a 37 which included two sixes.Rashid bowled Andy Balbirnie in the following over for two and Stirling started to run out of reliable partners.Mujeeb Ur Rahman claimed Stirling -- who as a consolation made Ireland’s top T20 score of 91 off 50 balls -- when he was caught by replacement Najeeb Tarakai on the boundary.The final match of the series is on Sunday. The two play five one-day internationals from February 28 and a one-off Test in March.",0
13,"After Elphinstone station stampede, Tendulkar sanctions Rs 2 cr from MP fund for Mumbai FOB workCricket icon and Rajya Sabha member Sachin Tendulkar has sanctioned Rs 2 crore from his Members of Parliament Local Area Development Scheme (MPLADS) fund for revamp of rail foot overbridges in Mumbai here in the backdrop of the Elphinstone Road station stampede.On September 29, 23 people were killed in the rush-hour stampede on a narrow foot overbridge (FOBs) linking Elphinstone Road and Parel suburban stations during heavy rain.Tendulkar, in a letter to Railway Minister Piyush Goyal, said he is requesting the Mumbai suburban district collector to authorise Rs 2 crore for constructions.He said Rs 1 crore each be alloted to Western Railway and Central Railway from his MPLADS fund “towards immediate revamp and construction of FOBs in as many high density, single bridge stations on the Western, Central (Main) and Central (Harbour) lines” that the official may deem urgent.“The recent incident at the Elphinstone Road station on Western Railway where innocent lives were lost in a stampede was devastating and I am moved to offer immediate support for the improvement of services for our Mumbaikars,” he wrote.“For the millions of those affected, it is not a happy Diwali in any sense, we must do all we can as responsible citizens to ensure this never happens again on any network in India,” Tendulkar said in the letter dated October 16.In the letter, also sent to the Mumbai suburban district collector, Tendulkar said he has asked the Railway Ministry, Railway Board and zonal heads “to study the possibility of creating two separate independent zones for the suburban services, a request that has been made by several experts, passenger and civil society groups.”“I think there is a merit in this request as it will bring dedicated manpower, funds and focus on the suburban network which ferries millions every single day,” he wrote.Every year, MPs are allotted Rs 5 crore under the MPLAD (Member of Parliament Local Area Development) Scheme, primarily to take up development projects in their respective constituencies.The fund has been increased over time, starting from Rs 5 lakh in 1993-94 to Rs 5 crore at present.",1
14,"Agencies drill holes in each other's theoriesEven as the Union urban development ministry claimed on Monday that there were no construction flaws when the high-speed airport Metro line opened in February 2010, Reliance Infrastructure, the concessionaire, maintained there were serious faults, which went unnoticed, from day one.The joint inspection by Indian Railways, Delhi Metro and Reliance Infrastructure of the damaged portions of the 22.7-km high-speed corridor revealed that at least 91% of the bearings in the civil construction (493 of 540 examined in the past week) were found to be defective. However, at a joint press conference called by the UD ministry, Delhi Metro and Reliance Infrastructure on Monday, the differences between the agencies emerged.Sudhir Krishna, secretary, urban development ministry, said, “There were no defects in the civil construction when the service on the line started in February 2010.” Sumit Banerjee, CEO (infrastructure), Reliance Infrastructure, countered: “There were damages since day one but they went unnoticed. They came to light during our recent annual inspection.”Meanwhile, the urban development ministry has ordered a proper examination. “Since the magnitude of damage is quite high, it has been ordered to examine all 2,100 bearings,” Krishna said.The ministry and the Railway board have formed a two-member inquiry committee to identify the responsible person/s or agency and investigate in details. As repair of these defects is likely to take a long time, the August deadline for the re-opening of the high-speed line will be missed, officials said. This means the wait for reopening the line has become indefinite.",1

17,"Allies consulted, made to toe linePoll bound allies of the UPA are worried by Friday’s fuel price hike. The Trinamool Congress and the DMK, both of whom have to face assembly elections next year, had to do some shadow boxing so as not to be seen as openly supporting the increase.The opposition, including the Left and the BJP, predictably, went all out to attack the government, demanding a rollback and blaming it for further stoking inflation.Food inflation on Thursday rose marginally to 16.96 per cent from 16.12 per cent last week.For the Trinamool and the DMK, it was a delicate balancing act.Railway Minister Mamata Banerjee stayed away from the meeting of the Empowered Group of Ministers though the increase of diesel prices would directly impact her ministry. Railway ministry officials, however, said that although the the fuel hike would increase its expense on diesel by Rs 470 crore, passenger fares will remain untouched.Fertiliser and Chemical Minister M.K. Alagiri simply read out a note to say that the hike would push up prices of other items further. “Any further increase will hit the purchasing power of the lower middle income families,” he said.When he even proposed a rollback, Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee snapped: “What rollback?” Alagiri fell silent.Banerjee said later, “I am unhappy and we do not support the hike.” But she clarified, “We do not want to quarrel as it won’t look nice. I will talk to the government to reconsider”.The government did consult allies on Thursday before taking the decision.Petroleum Minister Murli Deora spoke to DMK’s A. Raja and Mukherjee had an hour-long discussion with Banerjee. The Trinamool leader made it clear that she will not attend the EgoM as it could send a wrong signal to her electorate.At Friday’s meeting, Agriculture Minister and NCP chief Sharad Pawar said that if the government wanted a hike it must not dither on it. “If God is willing, prices will come down in future.”The Congress was on the defensive. “The government must have been constrained to take this step,” said spokesperson Jayanthi Natarajan.Privately many Congress workers expressed their unhappiness with the hike that is being seen as hurting the aam aadmi.The BJP demanded that the taxes should be rationalised to make fuel cheaper and dismissed the government’s defence that it was the NDA that had started to dismantle the administered pricing mechanism first.",1

This is how they came home,” tweeted former Northern Army commander Lt Gen (Retd) HS Panag, along with the images of the bodies.

The report, published in thewire.in, said Shah’s company Temple Enterprises Pvt Limited was “engaged in negligible activity” in the financial years ending March 2013 and 2014 but “jumped to a turnover of Rs 80.5 crore in 2015-16”. The company had taken an unsecured loan during the year for Rs 15.78 crore, the news report said, adding that it finally wound up in October 2016 after posting a loss. Jay Shah issued a statement saying the article “makes false, derogatory and defamatory imputation against me by creating in the minds of right thinking people an impression that my business owes its ‘success’ to my father Sri Amit Bhai Shah’s political position.” Read the story here.Send your child to school or be locked up in jail with no food, water: UP ministerUttar Pradesh minister Om Prakash Rajbhar has warned that parents who fail to send their wards to schools will be locked up in police stations without food and water.

In an unprecedented move, the ministry has brought to an end a 36-year-old protocol where it was mandatory for general managers to present themselves on arrival and departure of the Railway Board chairman and other board members during zonal visits. As part of a massive overhaul of the culture of privilege prevalent in the ministry, the Railway Board has decided to do away with the instructions of a 1981 circular that mandated such protocol.

May and leading lights in the Conservative Party took to the print media on Sunday to warn of unrest paving the way for Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn into Downing Street. May appeared to have survived another threat to her leadership after a bid to oust her by former party chairman Grant Shapps collapsed when it did not find much support among party MPs.

After the win in Ranchi in the first T20 of the three-match series, Virat Kohli-led side can very well hope for another series triumph against the team from Down Under. The dominance of the Virat Kohli-led side in the past few months has shown its potential to be one of the greatest Indian sides ever. It very well reminds of the MS Dhoni-led Indian team that dominated world cricket a little while back. Even reaching the heights of Steve Smith or Ricky Ponting-led Australian cricket teams is no longer a distant dream, it seems. “In the current era there are many teams who are almost at par. So, it would be great if we achieve the same results now, what Australia did in old days,” Dhawan, who remained unbeaten on 15 in India’s nine-wicket win in the first T20I, said.

It has become a victim of coalition politics in both UPA-I and UPA-II. The ministry has become an orphan and is surviving without any protection or guidance,"" BJP spokesperson Jagat Prakash Nadda said.The party, led by its president Nitin Gadkari, condoled the death of over 60 people due to derailment of Kalka mail at Fatehpur in Uttar Pradesh on Sunday.Nadda held Prime Minister, who has kept the Railways portfolio with himself since Mamata Banerjee resigned to become chief minister of West Bengal, responsible for the poor state of affairs in the ministry.""The Prime Minister is squarely responsible for this... It is his weakness that he never intervened when Lalu Prasad and Mamata Banerjee were running the ministry,"" he said.He alleged that the UPA government was ""insensitive"" and warned that ""passing the buck"" will not do.Nadda also blamed former railway ministers Mamata Banerjee and Lalu Prasad for the problems being faced by Indian Railways today.""As Railway Minister in UPA-I, Prasad had made tall claims of profits and given wrong figures. He also projected himself as a management guru at that time. Mamata Banerjee, who succeeded him, deflated his tall claims. But this ministry has now become a joke which is unbearable,"" Nadda said.Referring to the recommendations of the HR Khanna committee, appointed by the NDA government to study rail safety and other issues, Nadda asked why it was shelved.""In 2002-03, the Khanna Committee had recommended a Rail Safety Fund with a corpus of Rs 15,000 crore. The Atal Bihari Vajpayee government had sanctioned Rs 17,000 crore after factoring in inflation,"" he said.Enumerating other achievements of the Railway ministry during the erstwhile NDA government, the BJP spokesperson maintained that 17,000 km of rail track renewal, building of 3,000 rail bridges, upgrading of signals at 950 stations and improvement in security and other policy matters were approved by the Vajpayee regime.He alleged that all these projects were abandoned by the ministry once Lalu Prasad took charge. He further accused Banerjee of contributing her bit to the deterioration of the ministry.""The Railway Ministry migrated to Kolkata during Mamata Banerjee's time. She had a Vision 2020 but we all know her vision right from the time she took office was something else,"" Nadda said, alluding to Banerjee's aim of becoming the chief minister of West Bengal during her tenure as railway minister.The BJP General Secretary said Sunday's accident was a result of lack of long term planning by the ministry.""The Minister of state for railways (Mukul Roy) was not ready to go to the site of the accident. He had to be told by the Prime Minister to go. Railways is suffering due to coalition compulsions. No monitoring of projects is being done. One lakh posts of traffic and security personnel are lying vacant. Political will is needed,"" Nadda said.In his condolence message, Gadkari said the government did not take immediate steps to improve rail safety and the situation deteriorated further. He urged the government to take prompt and effective steps for the safety of people.",1

So what is the harm in paying for a service that will be available on their mobile phone,” said a senior railway official, requesting anonymity.The mobile ticketing for suburban trains was first announced in the 2014-15 interim budget presented in February 2014. However, the project didn’t take off until July — its original deadline.With this service, commuters will be able to book tickets and renew seasonal passes on their mobile. Each commuter will receive a code via SMS after booking the ticket and the money will be deducted from their mobile wallet, which they have to create with the railways.Railway officials are also in the process of creating an interface with banks where the ticket amount can be also deducted through internet banking.The commuter has to insert this SMS code into an Automatic Ticket Vending Machine (ATVM) and procure the printed ticket. The service will initially be available at five stations on the Western Railway (WR) and Central Railway (CR), respectively.On CR, the service will be available at Kalyan, Kurla, Dadar, CST and Thane stations, while Churchgate, Bandra, Dadar, Andheri and Borivli on the WR will have the service.Gradually, these ATVMs will be installed at all stations, said the railway official.Commuter activists, however, claimed the additional charges are not justified.“Railways are not incurring much cost to provide the service. Rather, they should consistently increase the fare and invest in better rail infrastructure and new projects,” said Ashok Datar, transport expert.",1

Roads And Railways ProjectsBy Accommodation Times News ServiceThe Centre gave its green signal for investments worth more than Rs.27,000 crore in new highways and railway lines across the country to boost economic growth.The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) approved infrastructure projects worth Rs.27, 328 crore for expansion of railway lines in 11 states and development of 1,120 km national highways in five states.“The Cabinet decisions are a continuation of the government’s commitment to support infrastructure development particularly expanding the national highways beyond the existing ones,” said Manish Agarwal, partner and leader, infrastructure, PwC India. “This will augur well for passenger and freight movement and is very positive for the infrastructure sector, he said.Infrastructure boostThe government plans to increase its investments in the infrastructure sector. About 8,300 kilometres of roads involving more than Rs.1 lakh crore investments were revived, said Finance Minister Arun Jaitley in his Budget speech. Total investments earmarked in the current fiscal for roads and railways sectors amounts to Rs.2.18 lakh crore. The Centre is also augmenting port capacity by developing greenfield projects in both eastern and western coasts. In the aviation sector, the Centre plans to revive torpid airports.The railway expansion programme includes nine projects involving 1,937 km of track construction at an estimated cost of Rs.20, 867 crore. The projects include construction of second railway line between New Bongaigaon and Kamakhya in Assam. The government also gave its approval to build third and fourth railway line projects on the North South and East West Corridors of the Golden Quadrilateral.The Railway Ministry said the “fully saturated” Golden Quadrilateral will get a “big boost” helping in transportation of coal, minerals, steel and other commodities. This will also enable transportation of more passengers along these routes.“At present, the number of passengers and goods trains in the Golden Quadrilateral section is far more than its capacity resulting in heavy detention. These projects are essentially required for removing capacity constraints, reducing detention and for traffic growth,” the Railway Ministry said.Among the projects approved are third railway lines between Kharagpur and Adityapur (Jharkhand), Itarsi and Nagpur (Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra), Ballarshah and Kazipet (Maharashtra and Telangana) and Vijayawada and Gudur (Andhra Pradesh).Similar third railway lines will also be built between Rajnandgaon-Nagpur (Kalumna) in Chhattisgarh and Gondia, Bhandara and Nagpur Districts of Maharashtra, Mathura and Jhansi and Jhansi and Bina in Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh.Besides, the CCEA has also given its nod to construction of fourth railway line between Jharsuguda and Bilaspur (Odisha and Chattisgarh). The construction of these railway lines is expected to be completed in four to six years.Highway connectivityAs a part of the National Highways Interconnectivity Improvement Project (NHIIP), the government approved constructing 1,120 km national highways in Karnataka, Odisha, Bihar, Rajasthan and West Bengal with World Bank assistance. The work is scheduled to be completed by July 2024 at an estimated cost of Rs.6, 461 crore.These projects will ensure safe, fast and all weather movement of traffic on the proposed national highways mostly located in backward regions thereby improving socio-economic development, an official statement said. In a separate move, the CCEA has also approved waiver of penal interest on the Government of India loans availed by Cochin Port Trust to the tune of Rs.897 crore. The Cochin Port Trust had availed Rs.168 crore worth loans between 1936-37 and 1994-95 for various development activities from the Centre. Non-payment of loans had attracted penal interest of Rs.914 crore, according to an official statement.The Cabinet also approved leasing out 4,060 square metres of Airports Authority of India (AAI) land to Assam Industrial Development Corporation (AIDC) for setting up Centre for Perishable Cargo and its future expansion at the Guwahati Airport.",1
31,"Can we repair the train while it is running?Indian trains run at an average speed of 50-70km per hour — fairly low when compared to the trains in developed countries. Yet, train accidents in India are phenomenally higher in comparison. In 2016-17 alone, train accidents in India have resulted in 238 causalities. This despite the fact that the number of accidents ‘per million train kilometres’ in India has reduced to 0.1 in 2016-17 from 0.23 in 2006-07. Worse still, according to a study by Niti Aayog, six of every 10 rail accidents in India since 2012 have happened due to human negligence.Every time an accident happens, heads roll and a few railway officials are punished but clearly this does not seem to change the scenario much. Therefore, we may need to remind ourselves of how we landed ourselves into this situation and what is that we can do to improve it.Stocktaking must start from a simple acknowledgement that among other things, the Indian Railways has been treated as a political tool by successive governments. Back in the early 20th century, most of the Indian Railways was nationalised but since its budget formed a significant portion of the total finances of the exchequer, a practice of separate Railway budget was institutionalised from 1924 to ensure that it acts as a commercial undertaking having flexibility in financial matters and higher accountability in administration and operation.But over a period of time what evolved out of this arrangement was a split personality for Indian Railways – an observation also made in the Indian Railways Report 2001 authored under the chairmanship of Rakesh Mohan.The report suggests that on one hand Railways was to act like a self-sufficient commercial organisation while on the other, it has had large social obligations to discharge by virtue of the fact it was a government department.It goes without saying that the performance parameters of commercial projects can be quite different compared to social projects. While the former may entail focus on elements like revenue, profits or return on capital the latter may demand expansion of connectivity or increase in traffic.",1

The survey noted: ""Total area under castor in India for the year 2018-19 is estimated to be 769570 hectares as per the government’s estimates against 2017-18 estimate of 821600 hectare, which has decreased by 7% compared to the previous year. • Acreage has been reported to have declined in Gujarat, the largest growing state, but it is expected to be almost flat in Rajasthan and Andrhra Pradesh/Telangana. • Average yield for year 2018-19 is estimated slightly down, -12.6%, to 1520 Kg/Ha compared to 1740 Kg/Ha, based on farmer’s response about their yield expectation on present crop conditions."" SEA conducts Castor crop survey for crop estimation in major growing states like Gujarat, Rajasthan, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana every year. This year, SEA commissioned Indian Agribusiness Systems Ltd, known as “Agriwatch” in the industry, to conduct a crop estimation study in above states through field surveys and remote sense data analysis. Total area under castor in Gujarat for the year 2018-19 is taken to be 533800 hectares as per the government’s estimates, against last year’s estimate of 591000 hectares, which has declined by about 10% as compared to the previous year. Agriwatch field survey suggests area under castor to be less by 6% this year as compared to last year’s government estimate and is estimated at 554160 hectares. Using remote sensing technique, the castor acreage for the state is estimated at 549000 hectares, for .. The major reasons for lower acreage this year is less rainfall in key growing belt. ""Estimated average yield for year 2018-19 is expected to be 1751 Kg/ha against last year’s estimate of 2029Kg/ha, a fall by 13.7%. Overall, the farmers are expecting decline in yield this year due to weak monsoon, less growth of plants and less availability of water for irrigation. Total seed production in the state with decrease in area (-10%) and less yield (-13.7%), is estimated down to 9.35 lakh tons in 2018-19 from last year’s estimate of 12.00 lakh tons. The seed arrivals have started in mandis as farmers are selling in small lots to get the higher prevailing prices,"" observed the survey.",0
34,"Central Railway block on day dedicated to punctualityIn a major faux pas, the Central Railway (CR) will operate a six-hour block that will lead to the cancellation of 40 suburban trains and regulation of 20 long-distance trains on Sunday, which was dubbIn a major faux pas, the Central Railway (CR) will operate a six-hour block that will lead to the cancellation of 40 suburban trains and regulation of 20 long-distance trains on Sunday, which was dubbed Satarkata Diwas and, ironically, dedicated to punctuality.Each zonal railway was expected to show 100 per cent punctuality on the occasion, which was created to mark Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s two years in power. The initiative comes under the Hamsafar Saptah, which began on May 26 and will go on until June 1.Mr Modi had issued a diktat across 17 zonal railways, in which instructions have been given that they should observe Sewa Divas on May 28 (Saturday) and Satarkata Diwas on May 29. The Prime Minister has asked railway officers to get down to the grass-roots level on Sewa Divas and travel in trains that they run for the common man.The senior officers were also instructed to talk to passengers themselves and understand their grouses. On the following day — Satarkata Diwas — railway officials were supposed to maintain the best punctuality that is humanly possible by showing a scoreboard of 100 per cent.However, the CR has decided to operate a six-hour block from 12 am on Sunday for laying down girders for the Kasaiwada bridge at Kurla.The CR had demolished the bridge back in December last year, fearing a repeat of the Hancock bridge incident.The Railways could not bring in new rolling stock of a much greater height than old trains, as officials were afraid that the overhead equipment would crash into the bridge, which was located between the Suburban railway stations of Sandhurst Road and Byculla.A railway official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, admitted that the block should have been operated a long time ago.“The fact of the matter is the CR should have operated this block way back. It unnecessarily wasted time on other things and no one gave any thought to the Prime Minister’s anniversary and that he might declare some railway initiative,” said the official.Some officials feel that the block should have been cancelled after the railway week was declared by the railway ministry on May 25, but said that they couldn’t deny that if the block of the bridge was not carried out this weekend, they would have had to wait until the post-monsoon period.“Kurla residents are angry as it is because Ramzan is round the corner and the bridge, which is the only connect the east and west, is nowhere near completion. At the same time, it looks like we are going against the instructions from Delhi and saying we have too much work. But we could afford to not operate the block this weekend had the senior officials done the Kurla work on time,” the official said.",1

Jagan Reddy is Naidu’s bitter rival and a strong contender for the chief minister’s post.Srinivas, the father-in-law of actor and grandson of matinee idol NT Rama Rao Jr NTR, evaded a direct reply from the media on whether he would be joining Jagan’s party. Rama Rao was the founder of the TDP.He is reportedly aspiring for a YSRC ticket from either Guntur Lok Sabha seat or Chilakaluripet assembly segment in Guntur district in the general elections to be held this year. Sources in the TDP said Srinivas is a strong contender for a ticket for Chilakaluripet assembly segment since 2004. But Naidu, it is said, did not entertain his requests to avoid criticism of supporting dynastic politics.Jr NTR is married to Srinivas’ daughter Lakshmi Pranathi, who is the granddaughter of Naidu’s sister. The daughter of the chief minister’s sister is married to Srinivas. And, Naidu is NTR’s younger son-in-law. Srinivas founded a regional TV channel Studio N, which was reportedly taken over by Naidu’s son and IT minister Nara Lokesh.Daggubati Venkateswara Rao, the elder son-in-law of NTR, also met Jagan Reddy on January 27 wishing to join the YSRC and eying a ticket for his NRI son Hithesh.TDP spokesperson Dokka Manikya Varaprasad said Srinivas and Daggubati met Jagan Reddy just for seats.Srinivas’ meeting came right after Lok Sabha member P Ravindranath resigned from the Telugu Desam Party and joined the YSRC in the presence of Jagan Reddy.Jr NTR, who took an active part in the 2009 election campaign for the TDP, was allegedly sidelined in the legacy politics which shifted from the NTR family to Naidu after the chief minister took over the party reins from NTR in 1995.The actor’s father and NTR’s elder son Harikrishna, who was recently killed in a road accident, also remained away from party activities after serving the TDP as a politburo member.",0

Demand for cars, two-wheelers, white goods is sluggish. Consumer non-durables, the growth is over 12%. It is the consumer durable which is sluggish and in negative growth,"" he told PTI in an interview in New Delhi.He said manufacturing capacity is there but sentiments must change for buying durable goods.""That is one part of manufacturing. The other part of manufacturing is the core sectors - steel, iron ore, coal, power, minerals. Manufacturing must grow there also. Output must increase. We must produce more coal, more iron ore, more steel, more aluminium. That will happen as the upturn takes place,"" he said.For example, the minister said, coal production has improved while iron ore which is caught in a number of litigations will hopefully clear with Supreme Court hearing the case.""But many other core industries, the projects are stalled which is why we have now identified the projects which are stalled and we are trying to remove these bottlenecks and things will begin to move.""I think work is at pace. A special cell has been constituted. The Cabinet Secretariat is looking at the projects that can be cleared in next few week.If they require a decision by the Cabinet Committee on Investment (CCI), we will bring it. Once the core sector production goes up, you will find the industrial sector moves up and manufacturing also moves up,"" he said.Chidambaram said the Indian economy was taking time to return to high growth trajectory because of the problems in the western economies.""The upturn (in global economy) that is expected has not taken place. At the same time there is no spiralling down either. I think our economy is getting stabilised. There are some weaknesses ... There are signs that we are moving towards a more stable period. It will take time,"" he said.The minister said the upturn will not happen quickly. ""It is a slow climb. The correct approach is to keep the focus on long term. There are no quick fixes. Take measures for long term and while these measures get implemented, the medium and short term will be addressed,"" he said.The government in recent weeks taken a number of decisions like hiking gas prices, setting up of coal regulator and allowing power producers to import coal to meet shortage.""The last few weeks we have taken a number of measures keeping the long term in mind. They will yield result on the long term, but as they yield result in long term the medium and short term problems will be addressed. There will be many more decisions in July,"" Chidambaram said.He said the Union Cabinet will decide on raising FDI caps in different sectors in the second or third week of this month.""Papers will have to come from the ministry of railway, from the ministry of coal, ministry of mines, from Planning Commission, from the ministry of petroleum, ministry of fertilisers. So hopefully many of these papers will come in July and we will take decisions on them,"" Chidambaram said.The government, the minister said, has been successful in containing fiscal deficit, increasing revenue collection and promoting savings.",1

41,"Court seeks answer from rail ministryA week after the Hindustan Times exposed the deplorable conditions in which train passengers were being forced to travel, the Delhi High Court has sought a response from the Railways Ministry on inadequate security for passengers.The order came on a public interest litigation (PIL) that cited the three-part series, ‘India Derailed’, carried by HT and said despite claiming profit of Rs 70,000 crore, the railways was not spending a penny on passenger security and “providing hygienic atmosphere”.Expressing serious concern over the increase in the incidents of robbery and loot in trains, especially after sundown, the petition filed by Supreme Court lawyers Usha Nandini and Biju Raman said: “The trains in India are no longer safe for night travel”.A Bench of Chief Justice Ajit Prakash Shah and Justice Sanjiv Khanna wanted to know the steps the ministry was taking to ensure security, and the money being spent on it.The Bench, while refusing to be drawn into other complaints raised in the petition for the time, concentrated on the security aspect.The judges asked the ministry, Railway Board chairman, Southeast Central Railway’s general manager and divisional manager to send in the reply by April 15.Nandini had filed the PIL following a robbery on board the Delhi-Thiruvananthapuram Kerala Express.

43,"Data on mishaps suggest railways’ track record has actually improvedIn the past, when there were two sources to find the number of accident in railways, people often tried to match the two, failing to recognise there were definitional differences between themFor purposes of reporting and analysis, Indian Railways actually classifies accidents under several heads – from A to R(AFP)The National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) brings out an annual publication, Crime in India. In the past, this has also been used as source for figures on railway accidents. For example, in 2015, 26,066 people died because of railway accidents and 2,650 because of railway crossing accidents. Since 2016, NCRB no longer publishes figures on railway accidents. It only has numbers on crimes in railways. Therefore, the sole source for data on railway accidents is now Indian Railways (IR), such as Indian Railways, Year Book.In the past, when there were two sources, people often tried to match the two, failing to recognise there were definitional differences between them. Let me give you a quote from the latest Year Book. “There were 103 consequential train accidents in 2016-17 as compared to 106 accidents during 2015-16.” This does not include Konkan Railway. Notice the qualifier. We think IR reports all accidents; but IR reports only “consequential accidents”, or “serious accidents”. What is a consequential accident? An accident is anything that adversely affects the engine, rolling stock, permanent way and works, fixed installations, communications, passengers or railway servants. We usually think of accidents from a passenger perspective. But there are other angles.For purposes of reporting and analysis, IR actually classifies accidents under several heads — from A to R. For instance, A1 and A3 will be collisions of trains carrying passengers; A2 or A4 collisions of trains not carrying passengers; B represents fire or explosion in trains; C, trains running into road traffic and/or road traffic running into trains at level crossings; D, derailments; E, other train accidents; F, averted collisions; G, breach of block (a block is a segment of the track) rules; H, a train passing a signal at danger; J, equipment failures; K, failure of permanent way; L, failure of electrical equipment; M, failure of signalling and telecommunication; N, unusual incidents; P, casualties; Q, other incidents; and R, miscellaneous.What’s the difference between an unusual incident and other incident? N would be wrecking or sabotage, not usually expected. Q6 would be something like “blockade to train services due to agitation”, not something that can be classified as an unusual incident. You can see why IR’s approach to accidents is different. L2 is “no tension in OHE (overhead equipment) for more than three minutes”. This may not fit with our usual perception of an accident, but the effect can be disastrous.Read moreTo improve performance, Indian Railways must streamline the flow of trafficAcquiring land for bullet train project may get delayed, says Piyush GoyalWe are still left with the question. What is a consequential or serious accident? Certain threshold values are defined for loss to railway property and interruption to communications. A serious accident is one where there is a loss of life or grievous hurt to passengers, or those threshold values are exceeded, or where the Commissioner of Railway Safety (CRS) thinks an inquiry is needed. Data on railway accidents are also available through CRS. However, CRS doesn’t enquire into every railway accident and CRS data about accidents only include those where there has been a CRS inquiry.That Year Book will also tell you IR attended to 982 accidents in 2016-17. How can this possibly match with 103? It doesn’t because 103 refers to those that are “consequential”. There are some exclusion clauses that must be noted too: “ (a) cases of trespassers run over and injured or killed through their own carelessness or of passengers injured or killed through their own carelessness; and (b) cases involving persons being Railways servant or holding valid passes/tickets or otherwise who are killed or grievously injured while travelling outside the rolling stock of a passenger train such as on foot board, roof or buffer but excluding the inside of vestibules between coaches or run over at a level crossing or elsewhere on the railway track by a train; and (c) level crossing accident where no passenger or railway employee is killed or grievously hurt unless the Chief Commissioner of Railway Safety or Commissioner of Railway Safety is of the opinion that the accident requires the holding of an inquiry by the Commissioner of Railway Safety.”The exclusion clause makes it clear that a serious accident only includes instances where there is IR culpability. We might want to change this, but that’s the way it is today.The next time you see a figure on railway accidents, bear these in mind. If you want to check IR’s track record, ask yourself what you are interested in. Fatalities and/or injuries on trains, or fatalities/injuries at level crossings? Collisions, derailments, fires? Whatever the yardstick, you will find (a) cross-country, IR doesn’t do that badly; (b) Over time, the performance has improved. Outside the Year Book, there are 2017-18 numbers and they tell the same story.Bibek Debroy is chairman of Economic Advisory Council to the prime minister and a member of Niti AayogThe views expressed are personal",0
44,"Decision soon on removal of Pakistan cricketers’ photos from Eden Gardens: Sourav GangulyFormer India captain and Bengal cricket boss Sourav Ganguly Saturday said a decision would be taken soon on removal of Pakistan cricketers’ photographs, including that of PM Imran Khan, from the walls of Eden Gardens in the wake of the Pulwama terror attack.Ganguly’s comment came after BJP’s youth wing workers protested in front of the Eden Gardens, seeking removal of photographs of Imran and other Pakistani cricketers from the walls of the stadium.At least 64 activists of BJP youth wing were arrested for staging protest in front of the iconic Eden Gardens, a senior police officer said. They were later released on bail.“We are working on it. There will be a decision soon,” Ganguly told reporters when asked about the removal of photos.The state cricket associations of Vidarbha, Punjab and Rajasthan have already removed pictures of Pakistan cricketers in the aftermath of the terror attack which killed more than 40 CRPF personnel. Pakistan-based terror outfit, Jaish-e-Mohammad, has claims responsibility of the attack.Ganguly had earlier backed a complete boycott of cricketing ties with Pakistan, saying not playing the arch-rivals in the upcoming World Cup won’t have much of an impact on the Indian team’s campaign at the mega event in May-July.Days later, Sachin Tendulkar said he would ‘hate’ to give away two points to Pakistan by not playing in the World Cup and India should rather beat them again in the showpiece event to maintain their unbeaten record over the arch-rivals.“He wants two points against Pakistan, I want the World Cup so...he wants two points I want the World Cup. Whichever way you look at it,” Ganguly said, reacting to Tendulkar’s comments.Eden Gardens has photographs of Imran, Wasim Akram and others kept in non-public areas of the stadium.Former and current cricketers have expressed varied opinions on severing cricketing ties with Pakistan.Many ministers of West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee’s cabinet, including former Bengal captain Lakshmi Ratna Shukla, hit out at BJP for trying to divert nation’s attention from terrorism.“We are more keen on removing terrorism from the world rather than pulling down photographs (of sportspersons). The BJP is trying to divert the attention from the current issue of terror attack. This is clear politics going on in the country,” Shukla said.State Municipal minister and city mayor Firhad Hakim when contacted said people should not confuse politics with sports and culture.Former cricketer and current Bengal coach Arun Lal said that the country was going through an emotional time and countrymen were venting out their feelings in different ways.“I can understand the feelings of my countrymen. I also share the same. This is a very emotional time. We have lost some of our brave brothers and obviously the country is hurt. But we also must understand that sports is not politics,” Lal said.",0

I have a good news for you all. The AAP government has covered your medical and social security needs by allocating Rs 50 crore in our budget, which will be presented next week. The allocation will be in effect from April 1,” he said.The CM said this amount was not a one-time fund and that it would be an annual allocation, which is likely to increase year on year.In a second sop to the lawyers, Kejriwal promised that after the Lok Sabha elections, the Delhi government would direct the Delhi Electricity Regulatory Commission (DERC) to permanently change electricity connections of their chambers from commercial to domestic.“This will help you save a lot on your electricity bills. The Delhi government has been giving Rs 230 crore as subsidy to lawyers at present to match the difference. Once DERC makes this change in its tariff order after elections, then this subsidy will not be required,” he said.Kejriwal appealed to the lawyers to vote for AAP in the upcoming general elections so that Delhi could get the full statehood status.“Make us win on all seven seats, we will give full statehood to Delhi. We will raise the matter in Parliament. The powers we enjoy now is not even 10% of what Sheila Dikshit used to enjoy in her 15-year rule in Delhi. Now, I being the CM cannot even appoint my own peon,” he said.",0

48,"Did Pulwama suicide bomber hide explosives in stone quarry? PULWAMA/SRINAGAR: Intelligence sleuths across security establishments in Jammu and Kashmir will now be preparing a list of stone quarries that had got shut in south Kashmir in the last few months amid suspicion that Pulwama suicide bomber Adil Ahmad Dar may have hidden explosives in one of these units. Sources in intelligence agencies said while it was likely that the Jaish-e-Mohammad terrorist had used imported military grade RDX from Pakistan in the IED used in the February 14 Pulwama attack, the sophisticated gadgetry could have been provided at one of the local quarries. There are about 30-odd quarries in south Kashmir, including in Pulwama, Anantnag and Shopian. These quarries often use illegally procured explosives and detonators. According to details exclusively accessed by TOI, the agencies have been tasked to collect information on stone quarries, fertiliser and pesticide shops and explosive materials available in Srinagar and neighbouring districts. According to details exclusively accessed by TOI, the agencies have been tasked to collect information on stone quarries, fertiliser and pesticide shops and explosive materials available in Srinagar and neighbouring districts. Mining in Pantha Chowk and Athwajan areas of Srinagar city, and in neighbouring areas, has been banned due to ecological reasons. However, intelligence sources said that explosives, safety fuses, aluminium electric detonators and cords have been found at some of the shut quarries in south Kashmir. “We don’t want to leave anything to chance. It’s not easy to carry RDX, or any explosive material, in a huge amount in a car in a single day. We want to eliminate the possibility of the role of any local mining quarry in keeping the explosives at a safe place,” said a senior J&K intelligence official. Officials believe that the Jaish terrorist could not have brought the entire cache of explosives at one go and was certainly provided logistic support of these business units. Sleuths have also launched a manhunt for stolen vehicles reported between January first week and February 14 following the uncertainty over the make and model of the car used in the attack. Both NIA and J&K Police sleuths have been divided over the car model, whether it was a Maruti Eeco or Ford Ecosport. Did Pulwama suicide bomber hide explosives in stone quarry? PULWAMA/SRINAGAR: Intelligence sleuths across security establishments in Jammu and Kashmir will now be preparing a list of stone quarries that had got shut in south Kashmir in the last few months amid suspicion that Pulwama suicide bomber Adil Ahmad Dar may have hidden explosives in one of these units. Sources in intelligence agencies said while it was likely that the Jaish-e-Mohammad terrorist had used imported military grade RDX from Pakistan in the IED used in the February 14 Pulwama attack, the sophisticated gadgetry could have been provided at one of the local quarries. There are about 30-odd quarries in south Kashmir, including in Pulwama, Anantnag and Shopian. These quarries often use illegally procured explosives and detonators. According to details exclusively accessed by TOI, the agencies have been tasked to collect information on stone quarries, fertiliser and pesticide shops and explosive materials available in Srinagar and neighbouring districts. According to details exclusively accessed by TOI, the agencies have been tasked to collect information on stone quarries, fertiliser and pesticide shops and explosive materials available in Srinagar and neighbouring districts. Mining in Pantha Chowk and Athwajan areas of Srinagar city, and in neighbouring areas, has been banned due to ecological reasons. However, intelligence sources said that explosives, safety fuses, aluminium electric detonators and cords have been found at some of the shut quarries in south Kashmir. “We don’t want to leave anything to chance. It’s not easy to carry RDX, or any explosive material, in a huge amount in a car in a single day. We want to eliminate the possibility of the role of any local mining quarry in keeping the explosives at a safe place,” said a senior J&K intelligence official. Officials believe that the Jaish terrorist could not have brought the entire cache of explosives at one go and was certainly provided logistic support of these business units.

49,"Don't mind losing my job, says TrivediRailway minister Dinesh Trivedi had promised a “revolutionary” rail budget to some of his cabinet colleagues on Tuesday. But his party chief Mamata Banerjee smelled a “rebellion” in Trivedi’s budget instead after he hiked passenger fare—allegedly keeping her in the dark—and left him with two options: roll back the hike or quit.For the first time in the history of parliament, the railway minister’s own party opposed the budget and left him in the lurch. Many in the party believe, Trivedi will have to make a quick choice as Mamata Banerjee ruled out any compromise on her “pro-people” stand.Trivedi, however, tried to put a brave face: “I have done my work as the railway minister. Now I leave the rest to the God.”Although fares have been raised across all sections, a roll back in the suburban (2 paise per km), second class (3 paise per km) and sleeper class (5 paise per km) may mollify the Trinamool chief, sources close to her told HT. Banerjee reportedly sees these fare tweaks as anti-poor and anti-aam aadmi.If Trivedi refuses to roll-back and puts in papers before the rail budget is passed, that would be another unprecedented event in parliament’s history. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh will then have to steer the budget till its passage. The option of asking Trivedi to continue till the passing of the budget also remains with the PM. However, Mamata Banerjee may not agree to such arrangement. Poll: Is it time for Cong to part ways with Mamata?A furious Trinamool chief Mamata Banerjee, who had repeatedly warned Trivedi against tinkering with passenger fares in the run-up to the budget, claimed that the railway minister did not consult the party before raising the fares. There was no direct communication between the railway minister and his political boss“As railway minister, he has the right to take own budget decisions. But the fare hike is totally against the policies of Mamata Banerjee and the party,” Trinamool’s parliamentary party chief Sudip Bandopadhyay told HT after a livid Banerjee called him from Nandigram area of West Bengal and vented her ire.Banerjee’s temper reportedly further soared at Trivedi’s praises for the finance ministry. Railway ministry got a loan of Rs 3000 crore from the government to tide over its immediate financial crunch.“Trivedi may shower lofty praises on the finance ministry but that ministry has offered no help to make West Bengal a financially stable state.”Trying to bring the Indian railway back on track, Dinesh Trivedi gets derailed in Trinamool’s political tracks.",1
50,"Drunk drivers are a Delhi policeman’s nightmareDelhi Traffic Police officers say that “hostility” from drunk drivers is one of many reasons why just over 100 motorists were prosecuted for the offence everyday on an average last year in the national capital.Traffic police personnel in the national capital say they are frequently threatened, sometimes assaulted or even mowed down by motorists when they attempt to prosecute drunk driving.(HT?File )“Blow into the alcometer,” the traffic policeman’s order was loud and clear. The SUV driver pretended to blow, but actually held his breath towards the end. The policeman knew just how to deal with the situation. “Loudly count till 10,” was the next command.In the next few seconds, the policeman had scientific evidence of the motorist having 105 mg of alcohol per 100 ml of blood, more than thrice the permissible limit. But what followed next was just what the policeman at the picket near Connaught Place fears every evening.The policeman had to fight off threats of action and repeated phone calls asking him to let go of the driver.This was a relatively much easier situation for the policeman to handle.Traffic police personnel in the national capital say they are frequently threatened, sometimes assaulted or even mowed down by motorists when they attempt to prosecute drunk driving.On better days, a motorist snatches away their alcometer as was seen at Barakhamba Road last November.Traffic Police officers say that “hostility” from drunk drivers is one of many reasons why just over 100 motorists were prosecuted for the offence everyday on an average last year in the national capital.The 37,188 prosecutions for drunk driving in 2018 were 11% more than the 33,343 previous year, but road safety experts say these figures are just the “tip of an iceberg”.“The drunk driving checking is not as frequent and widespread given how rampant the menace is in Delhi. A driver’s judgement is badly impaired after drinking and he is just lucky to reach his destination without harming anyone,” says Piyush Tewari, founder of NGO SafeLife Foundation.As per a study in America, an increase of Blood Alcohol Concentration by 0.02% doubles the relative risk of a vehicle crash among 16-20 year old males. That risk increases to 52 times when the BAC is between 0.08% and 0.10%.In India, motorists are not allowed to drive if the alcohol content is found to be over 30 milligrams per 100 millilitres of blood.According to a late last year’s survey of 5,000 Delhi motorists who drink, 3,605 (72.1%) of them admitted to drinking after driving. The survey, which was conducted by NGO ‘Community Against Drunken Driving’, found that 1,768 of those drivers said they regularly took to the wheel after drinking while 1,837 said they drove under the influence of alcohol only occasionally.More importantly, 78.6% of the respondents said they were not checked for drunk driving in the last six months of the survey.“The enforcement agencies do not take the issue as seriously as it should be. They view it as a seasonal traffic offence which happens during festivals like Holi, Diwali and new years,” says Prince Singhal, the NGO’s founder.According to the 2017 data put out by the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways, drunk driving caused 124 mishaps in Delhi and left 24 people dead and 126 injured. Across the country, drunk driving was the reason for 14,071 mishaps which killed 4,776 people and injured 11,776.But Tewari dismisses the data saying that most drunk drivers get away after causing an accident, leaving investigators clueless about the condition of the driver.“Delhi is a hub of hit and run cases. Many motorists abandon their vehicles after a mishap. When they are caught after a day or two, there is no evidence of drunk driving,” says Tewari.The act of fleeing after a mishap or fighting with the police after getting caught for drunk driving arises from the relatively tough penalties for drunken driving, says Alok Kumar, joint commissioner of police (Delhi Traffic Police).“Drunk driving is one of five traffic violations which lead to seizure of driving license for three months. No motorist wants to part with their license. I haven’t heard of one drunk driver who accepted the penalties without fighting with the traffic police on duty,” says Kumar.What also scares the motorists is the possible arrest and imprisonment up to six months, impounding of their vehicles and penalty of Rs 2,000. “The repeat offenders are the ones who are usually the most aggressive because they can be jailed up to three years and fined Rs 3,000,” says JCP Kumar.Out on the roads, the traffic police officers say they not only face a host of excuses and tricks by offenders, but also violent behaviour that risks the lives of the general public.“Each of these drunk drivers knows some influential person or the other. It becomes very uncomfortable for us to fend them off. In case the driver doesn’t know someone who can bail him out, he will try to take a U-turn or speed away, without bothering about its consequences,” says a traffic police inspector in west Delhi’s Rajouri Garden.JCP Kumar says that after drinking most drivers have a “false sense of bravado” and believe they can drive better.The CADD study found that one in every four of its respondents believed they drive better after drinking.",0
51,"Dubai-bound plane hijacker had issues with wife, wanted to speak to Bangladesh PM:?OfficialsBangladeshi commandoes shot a passenger on Sunday who had tried to enter the cockpit of a Biman Bangladesh Airlines flight after waving a gun and threatening to blow up the plane, airline and aviation authority officials said.The passenger, who had said he had a personal issue with his wife and told the pilot he wanted to speak to Bangladesh’s Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, died later from the injuries suffered after the commandos stormed the plane at Chittagong’s Shah Amanat International Airport, officials said.“We tried to arrest him or get him to surrender but he refused and then we shot him,” said Major General S M Motiur Rahman of the Bangladesh Army.The man’s threat to blow up the plane, which was on its way to Dubai from Dhaka via Chittagong, led its pilots to make an emergency landing.Before the commandos moved in, all 142 passengers and most of the crew had been let off the aircraft unharmed. One crew member had been held hostage, the officials said.Air Vice Marshal Nayeem Hasan, chairman of the Civil Aviation Authority of Bangladesh, told reporters at a news conference that as well as holding what appeared to be a pistol the passenger said he had explosives bound to his body.With the plane close to Chittagong after leaving Dhaka, the passenger stood up from his seat and tried to go to the cockpit, according to aviation officials. When a member of the crew blocked his way, he showed his pistol.He then said he had explosives and if they didn’t open the door of the cockpit he would blow up the plane, officials said. Other members of the crew alerted the pilots to the problem and they asked air traffic control for an emergency landing.It was not immediately clear if he had explosives, though the pistol was real, according to a senior aviation official. It also wasn’t immediately clear if the pistol was loaded or how it got through security at the airport in Dhaka.The security questions are a matter of concern and would be the subject of an investigation, said the aviation official.The man appeared to be in his 20s, and was probably Bangladeshi as he was speaking Bangla, but his identity was not yet clear, Hasan said.",0
52,"Ease in procuring licences makes Delhi’s roads dangerousOut of 10 major cities, Delhi stood sixth in the list of drivers who had procured a licence without taking a test.There are 1,200 unauthorised motor training institutes in Delhi, a plea in Delhi High Court said.(HT?File )Overtaking from the wrong side, inching bumper-to-bumper with the car in front and wrongly navigating the city’s roundabouts — Delhi’s drivers have a lot to learn when it comes to safe driving practices.But if these basic rules were largely ignored, then how did these drivers get their licences?The Delhi government has of late started a major crackdown against the growing corruption in regional transport offices by launching dedicated helplines to report cases of corruption. The ease in procuring drivers’ licences in the city, however, was an issue that was ignored for years.This resulted in the growth of untrained drivers who know little about the rules to be followed once they are behind the wheels.Till very recently, touts who offered to even appear in tests on your behalf for a meagre payment of Rs 3,000-Rs 4,000, were a regular sight at transport offices.“We have a no-tolerance policy for touts who take bribes and offer to issue licences. We conduct regular inspections and have also put up boards for the awareness of people to report such activities,” said Delhi’s transport minister Kailash Gahlot.Startling figuresData released by the Union ministry of road transport and highways (MoRTH) showed that in 2017, around 80% of road accidents in India was caused by valid licence holders.A 2018 survey by road safety NGO SaveLife Foundation also corroborated this dangerous trend. Data showed that 59% driving licence holders in India never took a test and thus did not completely understand road safety rules.Delhi did not fare too well in this test either.Out of 10 major cities, Delhi stood sixth in the list of drivers who had procured a licence without taking a test. At least 54% of Delhiites, compared to the national average of 59%, claimed to have not taken the competency test while applying for their licences.Unauthorised driving schoolsA plea filed in Delhi High Court last year had sought action against around 1,200 unauthorised motor training institutes that had mushroomed in the national capital.The classes imparted by these private schools are usually spread over 15 days and comprise six to seven hours of training and charge anywhere between Rs 1,800 and Rs 2,500.A student, who may have never sat in the driver’s seat, is directly ushered onto the busy and dangerous roads of the city on the first day of the class.“There is nothing to worry. We have full control of the vehicle,” says Hari Lal, a 37-year-old trainer at a driving school in west Delhi.By mentioning control, Lal was referring to an additional set of brakes and clutch fitted into the passenger’s side of the car.“There is no chance of an accident. I’ll apply brakes the moment a student loses control of the steering,” he adds.Many students say they feel confident while being trained, but are clueless while taking their own vehicles on the roads later.“I was caught in a massive jam and just didn’t know how to negotiate my way out. I had to seek the help of another motorist to get out of the situation,” said Deepa Vijay, who was trained by an unauthorised school.Nitin Kumar, an IT professional, said he found the training imparted to be inadequate. “I had to go through the training a second time because I wasn’t taught how to reverse, how to do parallel parking, how to shift lanes or the right use of mirrors,” said Kumar.Kumar said he was never taught how to drive a car on a flyover in busy traffic. “There were many important instructions I never received. I took to YouTube videos to learn important things myself,” said Kumar.But Girish Sharma, president of All India Motor Driving School Association, believes that those trained by even the unauthorised schools are better than those who learn by themselves or are trained by family or friends. He said that barely 10% of all motorists seek training from driving schools.“The trainers are mostly those who quit authorised driving schools or are awaiting licence. They teach their students about road signs, how to handle practical situations, to ensure there is no one in front of or behind the car when they switch start a car,” said Sharma, adding that even the unauthorised school trainers did more good than bad.But Sharma said it was necessary that only authorised motor driving training schools were allowed to operate so that only properly trained people were allowed to teach others.Many learners said that these trainers also doubled up as agents who promised to help them get driving licences easily. “I have to attend the driving test, but I have been assured that I will pass, no matter my performance,” said a learner, who didn’t want to identify himself.Tougher tests and uniform licensingFrom July this year, all states will have to issue uniform licences with security features, which will allow police and security agency to access driver information on the spot. Road safety experts, however, said that the need of the hour is to fix the process of licence procurement.“The process of driver tests needs to be made more transparent. Learners’ tests need to ensure that the applicant knows the basic rules of driving before they hit the road,” said Madhumita Deshpandey, co-founder of Road Safety Records, a Delhi-based research organisation, which focuses on road infrastructure and safety.Recently, Delhi introduced a one-of-a-kind automated track test centre in Sarai Kale Khan. The centre makes getting a drivers’ licence difficult by stimulating tougher driving conditions.Experts also said that certifying driving trainers under government rules will also help ensure the training is up to the mark. In several cities in the US, retired police officials take up the task of training new drivers to ensure that the theory of driving is also mastered.",0
53,"Eight killed in 12-vehicle pile-up on Rohtak highwaySeveral accidents were reported from highways in the Gangetic plains which was covered by dense fog on Monday morning, reducing the visibility to bare minimum.Eight persons, including seven women, were killed in a vehicle pile-up due to dense fog on the Rohtak-Rewari highway in Haryana on Monday, police said. At least 10 others were injured in the accident that took place in Jhajjar district in which over 12 vehicles, including a school bus, were involved, they said.Several accidents were reported from highways in the Gangetic plains which was covered by dense fog on Monday morning, reducing the visibility to bare minimum. Former state health minister Satyanarayan Lathar was killed in Jind after an unidentified vehicle hit him when he was walking home from his petrol pump late on Sunday night, police said.According to police, all the victims in the Jhajjar accident were from Kirdodh village and were going to Najafgarh in Delhi in a jeep to condole the death of a relative there. The jeep collided with a pick-up vehicle and was hit by a speeding truck from behind, police said, adding that the injured were taken to Pt BD Sharma Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences in Rohtak.“Eight persons were killed in the accident that took place in the early morning. At least 12 vehicles were involved in the pile-up,” said Seema Devi, station house officer, Jhajjar police station.The pile-up occurred after the two vehicles collided on Badli Flyover on National Highway-71 and around 10 more piled up behind them due to poor visibility, leading to more injuries. There was a school bus involved in the accident, which led to a two-kilometre traffic jam, but none of the passengers was injured, police said.Seven women and one man who were sitting in the back of the jeep were killed, while two more sitting in the same vehicle were critically injured. The deceased have been identified as Satpal Kumar (48), his wife Kanta Devi (40), Santosh Devi (52), Prem Lata (50), Laxmi Devi (63), Ram Kali (35), Sheela Devi (61) and Khajani Devi (54). They were cremated in the village Monday afternoon amid a pall of gloom.“A woman in Satpal’s relation had died in Najafgarh, for which the entire family was going there to pay our condolence. The visibility was very poor due to fog. Only 20 minutes in journey, we were hit by a truck from behind and all this happened,” said Dheeraj, son of Santosh.The Haryana government has announced a compensation of Rs 2 lakh to the kin of the deceased. “Compensation of Rs 2 lakh will be given to the kin of the deceased, Rs 1 lakh to those severely injured and Rs 50,000 to those with minor injuries,” Haryana minister OP Dhankar said.The northern part of the country, including Haryana and Punjab, has been reeling under the cold wave for the past one week. “Cold weather combined with the availability of moisture will result in foggy conditions over Northwest India. This dense fog is likely to reduce visibility over Punjab, Haryana, North Rajasthan, Delhi and Uttar Pradesh, resulting in difficulty for commuters in the morning and noon hours,” stated Skymet, a private weather forecasting agency.Dense to very dense fog was observed at isolated places over Punjab and West Rajasthan and moderate fog at isolated places over Haryana, Chandigarh, Delhi and West Uttar Pradesh in the morning hours. Visibility in Amritsar and Ganganagar was 50 metres in the morning while in Delhi’s Palam it was 200 meters.",0

These were unserviceable anti-aircraft ammunition.On average, unserviceable ammunition has caused 65-70 accidents annually since 2013-2014.In May this year, an official of the Ordinance Factory died during a routine check of L-70 ammunition at a forward ammunition depot near Pathankot in Punjab. “The accident happened when a validation exercise for L-70 rounds was being carried. The round went off accidentally killing an OF official,” a senior army officer who didn’t want to be named said.Apart from ammunition for the L-70 guns, ammunition for tanks and Armoured Personnel Carriers are also a cause of concern for the Indian ArmyAs many as 19 personnel, including two officers, died when faulty anti-tank mines exploded at the Central Ammunition Depot in Phulgaon in May 2016. Surprisingly, while an internal inquiry pinned the blame on the Ordnance Factory and some of its officials, no was held accountable. Two officials found to be responsible by the inquiry have even superannuated, according to a second Ministry of Defence official who did not want to be named .An audit of faulty ammunition being done by the Department of Defence Production , which supervises the Ordnance Factory, was stopped following the death, this official added. “The Indian army has been promised an improved version of L-70 ammunition fuse next year by the Ordnance Factory Boards. The audit has restarted in July”.The issue is technology, a retired army officer said.“Ordnance factories have not been up to date with the technology upgrades; recently, Indian made ammunition for the newly procured M-777 Light Howitzers malfunctioned causing an accident. Ordinance factories must acquire new technology and maintain better hygiene,” Brigadier S Chatterjee (retd) said.Defence Ministry spokesperson, Colonel Aman Anand, did not respond to queries. Unserviceable ammunition isn’t the only concern for the Indian Army, Ordnance Factories have also consistently failed to produce adequate quantity of ammunition.“The present state of preparedness has created voids due to the limited production capacity of the Ordinance Factory and consistent slippage in production targets,” the Indian Army told a Parliamentary oversight committee on defence last year.Informing the Ministry of Defence and Parliamentary oversight committee, the Indian Army wrote, “Out of 22 items indented on Ordinance Factory Boards, as part of the Ammunition road map, 14 items were not supplied at all.”The Indian Army also asked for the accountability to be fixed on the Ordnance Factory Boards for “poor quality,” slippages” and delays in supply of ammunition.",0

59,"Follow transfer policy on sensitive posts: Ministry of RailwaysThe Ministry of Railways has issued directions to various departments to prepare a report on the implementation of the comprehensive transfer policy and ensure that incumbency on sensitive posts must not be allowed beyond the stipulated time of three years.   The ministry has asked for a report for implementation of transfer policy for rotation of officials working in sensitive regions to enable vigilance directorate to put the information for the perusal of higher officials.“It is reiterated that all concerned may examine the feasibility of transferring the officials working on sensitive posts at the earliest and ensure that no incumbent dealing with sensitive work continues on any sensitive post beyond the stipulated period as advised to zonal railways from time to time,” said the directive issued by railways.This comes after the Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) issued a directive in August this year reiterating that all government departments should ensure rotational policy on sensitive posts. It further said that analysis of frauds in public sector banks and other organisations show that one of the reasons for such frauds was non-implementation of the rotation policy.             The CVC had asked that all departments strictly follow rotational transfer policy and heads of all departments should ensure implementation of the policy.In 2015, Member of Parliament N F Patole had complained to the railway’s ministry about some officials occupying sensitive posts for over 15-20 years and creating hurdles in the transparent functioning of various departments. Patole also said that about 150 officials were posted at various levels in the Railway Board for over 15-20 years.",1
60,"From white jalebis to INS Vikrant, Naik’s memoir has it allIn a political career spanning over five decades, governor Ram Naik faced several interesting incidents that form a part of his memoir ‘Charaivati-Charaivati’ (Marching ahead, marching ahead) written in Marathi and now translated into Hindi, English, Urdu and Gujarati, which will be released by President Pranab Mukherjee at the Rashtrapati Bhawan in New Delhi on November 9.In Lucknow, his memoir would be released on November 11 in the presence of Union home minister Rajnath Singh and chief minister Akhilesh Yadav.In his labour of love, Naik has included interesting things he had to deal with right from rechristening Bombay to ‘Mumbai,’ use of edible colours in sweetmeats, preservation of INS Vikrant and even finding the Constitution of India written in Hindi on gold leaves!“As an MP, I was required to handle a plethora of diverse matters. One of them was prohibiting sweetmeat makers from using edible colours in their products. Union health minister AR Antulay was among my acquaintances. The makers argued that it would be more reasonable to order them to use only permitted food colours of specified quality. However, if the ban was implemented in toto, there would only be white sweets. Imagine eating white jalebis and pedhas,” said Naik.From sweetmeats to INS Vikrant, Naik quickly changes track and recalls how the INS Vikrant was declared a national monument but it had to be disposed off as a scrap due to the failure of Maharashtra and Central government in preserving the warship that helped India win the 1971 war against Pakistan.Recalling another interesting anecdote, the governor said how his initiative led to Bombay being rechristened as ‘Mumbai.’ And a simple query about the Hindi manuscript of the Constitution of India in the Parliament Library literally led him to the ‘golden book.’“While I was reading in the Parliament Library, I came across the original English edition of the Constitution. Curious, I asked to see the original Hindi edition of the Constitution. Quite an amusing tale unfolded from this simple query. The original Hindi edition was written down by Vasant Vaidya, a Maharashtra calligraphist. Gold plated pages were imported from Germany and a special kind of ink, used for writing this edition, was brought from a reputed firm in China. The writing instrument was a special pen, crafted by the famous Watkins Company, made in Washington State, USA. It had taken Vaidya a full year to complete the writing of the Constitution on the gold plated pages. The Hindi edition is decorated with sketches of Lord Shri Ram, Shri Krishna, Gautam Buddha, Rani of Jhansi and several personalities from our cultural and historic past.”Changing tracks once again, Naik while referring to his tenure as chairman of the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) says, “One of the major assignments of the PAC is to investigate in case of any dubious transaction made by various government agencies after they are recorded by the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG). I created a record by submitting eight reports of PAC in one year. The most sensational of these reports was about the misuse of official aircraft belonging to railway ministry by the then railway minister CK Jaffer Sharief. The charges against the minister were proven that put the government in a bind.”",1

All three of us were given upper berth making a sheer mockery of our age,” said Rana.“We were clueless as to how to climb up the berth as our knees are not much supportive,” he said, adding it was insensitive on the part of railways which compelled them to plead for berths from co-passengers.“It’s not our age and stature to beg for berth. What do titles like ‘Saraswati Putra’ mean for us when railways don’t even have the courtesy to respect our age,” he said.Read moreSummer heat can be dangerous for the elderly. 6 tips to protect them65-year-old in Mumbai cheated of Rs17.67 lakh in insurance fraudChief public relations officer, Northern Railways (NR), Nitin Chowdhary said: “Berth allocation system is programmed in a manner to give priority to senior citizens and female passengers in allocation of lower berths. However, once the lower berths get reserved, there is no choice but to allocate upper berths.”“As per the allocation system in AC-II, there is a provision to allocate only three lower berths on first come, first serve basis. It can be a woman above 45 years, a pregnant woman or any senior citizen,” he said.First Published: Apr 24, 2018 12:50 IST",1
62,"Govt mulls pvt role in rly, scrapping of fare subsidyScrapping the railway board, merging the rail budget with the main budget and withdrawing the passenger fare subsidy are among the radical reform proposals the government is considering, official sources said.Railways minister DV Sadananda Gowda is also contemplating a role for private stakeholders in policy-making and lateral entry for IAS officers into the top rail hierarchy to “de-centralise and corporatize” the functioning of the public transporter, which carries roughly 23 million passengers daily.“The railways served the nation well in the initial decades after Independence, but its administrative and institutional structure and functioning seems archaic and unscientific in the present context and needs overhaul. These tasks are huge and difficult and will need to be attempted progressively,” Rail Restructuring Committee chairman Bibek Debroy told HT.The committee was set up recently by the Indian Railways to take forward Gowda’s budget announcements on restructuring the rail ministry and railway board.All these reform proposals have been mentioned in the reports of several expert committees.A top government priority is to replace the “outdated and flexible” accounting practices with a professional “corporate accounting” system that can provide scientific data on the profits and losses of rail operations, the sources said.“The railways must eventually work towards… charging passenger fares commensurate with expenses incurred in providing for the cost of travel. But the progressive hike in fares will also have to be matched with better passenger amenities,” Debroy said.Currently, passenger fares are hugely subsidized, resulting in an annual loss of Rs. 25,000 crore in this segment. A proposal to merge the railways’ nine different cadre and provide for a single, unified cadre — to be called the Indian Railway Service — is also part of the surgical operation plan.",1
63,"Green patches, seats at regular intervals increase walkability quotientWhile on the one hand, Delhi has some of the most beautiful and pedestrian-friendly roads such as Sardar Patel Marg or Kasturba Gandhi Marg, it also has stretches such as the one between ISBT Kashmere Gate and Majnu Ka Tilla, where pedestrians are forced to walk on the main roads and risk their lives due to the lack of walkable footpath.Experts say greenery should be maintained round the year to make footpaths walkable. (Amal KS/HT Photo )Mention the word ‘walkability’ and it immediately conjures up an image of a foreign city such as Paris and London — with people walking on wide footpaths adorned with lush green trees and hedges, seats at regular intervals and colourful shops and eateries along the way. But a careful glance at our city will tell you that Delhi doesn’t have to look beyond its territory to understand what the term entails.While on the one hand, Delhi has some of the most beautiful and pedestrian-friendly roads such as Sardar Patel Marg or Kasturba Gandhi Marg with their canopy of trees, broad sideways with well-laid green patches, on the other hand, it also has stretches such as the one between ISBT Kashmere Gate and Majnu Ka Tilla, where pedestrians are forced to walk on the main roads and risk their lives due to the lack of walkable footpath.Elaborating on the issue, architect and urban planner, AGK Menon, said, “A walkable road needs proper planning and integration of greenery, aesthetics, safety and public utility right from the planning stages. But unfortunately, most roads in the city sans the ones in Lutyens’ Delhi lack this. Sometimes, you see a bus stop right in the middle of the footpath, sometimes, there are no trees to provide pedestrians with shade, and at times, the footpaths are dug up.”But then, one might ask, what does greenery have to do with walkability.The connectionA study conducted by the Delhi Traffic Police in 2016 revealed that road accidents in the New Delhi area — which has massive green coverage and continuous walking facilities for pedestrians — was at least 40 per cent lower than the rest of the city. It also showed that pedestrian deaths in accidents in this area were almost 85 per cent lower.The connection between green coverage and road accidents was first established by the government of Mexico City in 2015, which assessed some of the busiest and the most accident-prone stretches, for over a decade and increased the green coverage there. After the project was completed, it was seen that not only were accidents on the stretch controlled but also that incidents of road rage among drivers had gone down.In a statement released to the local media, the Mexico City government had said the green cover “had acted as a stress buster for drivers” who were otherwise more aggressive on roads. This, they said, became a boon for pedestrians, who had also found the newly developed area more accessible.“Greenery along sideways and footpaths not just provides shade and increases your convenience while walking, it also soothes your senses and keeps you happy and calm. The moment you start walking with your senses feeling the surrounding, it slows you down and acts as a recreation for you. The hedges along edges of footpaths keep you from getting down on the roads, thereby bringing down the chances of accidents,” said KT Ravindran, urban designer and former chairman of the Delhi Urban Art Commission.Curbing pollution woesThere are umpteen studies that have revealed how greenery along roads and footpaths could help bring down pollution. A latest study by researchers from the University of Surrey has shown that hedges can bring down vehicular pollution by more than 60 per cent.In 2009, the Indian Road Congress (IRC) had laid down certain guidelines and objectives that need to be followed while selecting plants.“The objectives while selecting a plant species — as laid down in the IRC — are to reduce air and dust pollution, arrest soil erosion, mitigate extreme climatic conditions, reduce noise pollution, among others. But these are hardly followed in plantation drives,” RNS Tyagi, former horticulture director of the Central Public Works Department, said.Experts said a mix-and-match of big canopy trees and hedges are ideal for footpaths. It, in fact, make roads more walkable.“Just like we need woods and greenery, we also need open spaces. Both are important for us. And for this, we need a proper plan. We can’t just go on planting trees just for the sake of greenery,” author and conservationist, Pradip Krishen, said.Moving aheadSo how exactly do we go ahead? Experts said that to integrate greenery with roads so that they could become more walkable should be the primary objective among planners right from the initial stages.“A major criterion while making a city or its roads walkable is to see that the walkbale streets do not end abruptly. They should have some continuity and end in open spaces such as a park,” said Ravindran.Planners also said the more interactive a footpath -- with lots of greenery instead of a mundane looking road with ‘dead’ walls — the more it will increase walkability.“If the road has spaces with greenery, shops and eateries, which a pedestrian can see, walkabilty increases. A dull road with walls blocking your sight reduces the walkability quotient,” Ravindran maintained.But just planting trees and hedges won’t help. Experts said that in an attempt to make roads and footpaths more walkable, greenery should be maintained round the year. Unless maintained, these green stretches could become shady dark places and become unsafe.“Whenever we think of widening a road or coming up with an infrastructure project, the first thing we see is that trees are chopped off. Sometimes, when footpaths are retrofitted, the bases of trees are all concretised despite a National Green Tribunal (NGT) ruling against such practices. Residents should be involved so that greeneries could be maintained more efficiently,” said Kanchi Kohli, legal researcher at Centre for Policy Research.",0

My eight-year-old son played with snow throughout the way.”Groom along with his family treks to Makku Math in Rudraprayag district for his wedding ceremony after roads were blocked due to heavy snow. (HT Photo)A wedding ceremony with only 25 people is rare in Uttarakhand, but one such wedding took place on Friday at Makku Math in Rudraprayag after the groom along with his relatives walked for over 6km in heavy snow to attend the ceremony.Around 80 people had left for from Triyuginarayan village in the district to attend Rajnish Kurmachali’s wedding ceremony at Makku Math, but were stuck in traffic after vehicular roads were closed due to snow. The family then decided to send only those people who were needed for the rituals such as the groom’s maternal uncle, sisters and some elderly people. The dolled up family undertook a 6km long unique marriage procession, with children playing in the snow to reach their destination.“We had seen a wedding procession like this in 2002 and now this was the next one. People will talk about this procession and the wedding for years as in both the weddings the groom was an army jawan,” said Ashish Gairola, the groom’s brother.Speaking on whether the journey was difficult for the family, Gairola said, “If you see the pictures then you would question whether they were even feeling cold, forget difficulty. My eight-year-old son played with snow throughout the way.”Since the last seven days, the village has not received power supply, making it difficult for them to carry out daily chores. The groom’s brother added that people have been charging their phone batteries through their cars due to power outage.Bijay Lal, head of Triyuginarayan village said, “Even I had to go to the wedding but were all stuck due to the snow. But those who went enjoyed the whole journey and the wedding took place without any problem.”Mangesh Ghildilyal, district magistrate of Rudraprayag said, ""We received information about this wedding where people had to walk all the way. It is good that they walked, as due to continuous snowfall, there are high chances of accident as cars can skid."" He added that machines have been deployed to clear the snow in the village but due to incessant snowfall the roads are still blocked.",0

In an exclusive interview with HT, Nishant threw light on what makes the show stand out from others, why it’s tough to work in the television industry and more.Actor Nishant Malkani is 31 and portrays the role of a father to three grown up men on TV show Guddan Tumse Na Ho Payega. With no grey hair in sight, the actor is seen as the husband of 20-year-old Guddan who owns the title of India’s youngest mother-in-law. In an exclusive interview with HT, Nishant threw light on what makes the show stand out from others, why it’s tough to work in the television industry and more. Excerpts:Tell us more about the show Guddan Tumse Na Ho Payega.The story is about a man and a woman who meet accidently and go on to tie the knot. Both of them are poles apart. While the woman is around 20 years old, the man is in his mid-thirties. The woman is very innocent and even though she has good intentions, she ends up screwing everything. On the other hand, this man is very mature but is still in love with his first wife. They get married accidently due to unexpected circumstances. This man is the adopted son of the family and ends up being a father to three sons and a father-in-law to their wives. So when he marries Guddan, she ends up becoming their mother-in-law as well (as told in the show’s tagline – Guddan India ki youngest saas hain).You play a father to three grown up men in the show. Were you not apprehensive about playing such a role?Initially, I was apprehensive but the makers convinced me about the theme of the show. They were not going to give me grey hair or make me look older. They told me how a lot of twists and turns were going to come in the story and that I was not their real father. What’s interesting about this character was that while he is an angry young man in front of everyone, he was a very chilled out and loud person in the company of his former wife. This is a man who will show his anger even when he is in a romantic mood.Taking a time leap is a common trend on Indian TV shows. If the makers take a time leap of 20 years, will you be ready to play a 50-60 year old on screen?I will be apprehensive but it completely depends on why and how they will justify the time leap. If I find it interesting, I will do it and if I won’t, I will step back.How do you bond with your team?We have a very good team, all of us are very good friends. We have a house party at one of the people’s houses on an off day. We bond like college friends when not working.You have also done a few films.My last film was Bezubaan Ishq in 2016. I do have plans to do films but I am committed for 25 days in a month for this show. As long as I am shooting for this one, I won’t be able to take out time for other things. But after that, I will pick up whatever interesting comes my way. It can be anything – a film, a web series or another TV show. Right now, all three platforms are doing so well that as an actor, there is a lot of scope for anyone to grow.What is the major difference between the television industry and Bollywood?In films, you have a bound script, you know the entire graph of the character and his journey from end to finish. In a television show, everything changes every week. The TRPs decide what works and what doesn’t work and what we are going to do with the story. If the character is not working, we change the character, if not the actor. As an actor, one has to be very flexible to adapt all the time. If the show goes on for a year, you have to come on the screen everyday but yet do something different to keep the audience hooked. I believe shooting a film is much easier than a TV show.",0

It took frequent spells of snow in January this year to bring large number of foreign tourists to Kashmir amid militancy.(HT?Photo )Located in the Pir Panjal Range in the western Himalayas, virgin peaks, dry curry powder snow and snow meadows define the cup-shaped valley Gulmarg in Baramulla district of Jammu and Kashmir. After a slump in tourism due to the killing of Hizbul Mujahideen commander Burhan Wani in July 2016, it took frequent spells of snow in January this year to bring large number of foreign tourists to Kashmir amid militancy.The good start to the tourist season of 2019 comes after the industry took a downturn in 2018, a year which witnessed military offensive. Over 8.5 lakh tourists including 50,000 foreigners visited the Valley in 2018 as compared to 11 lakh in 2017. Tourism director Nisar Wani said ,“We received 25,095 tourists across Kashmir in January this year, including 2,480 foreigners,” Wani said.The arrival of foreign tourists has seen a surge. The figure was 1,405 in 2016, 1,170 in 2017, 2,369 in 2018 and 2,480 in 2019. Domestic tourists in January 2018 were 49,000. Wani said domestic arrival was affected as national highway closed due to snowfall for 12 days in January. “The highway closure also increased the price of air tickets exponentially. However, we continue to see more tourists. On February 3, 2019, we saw the highest daily arrival of 1,400,” he added.A chance discovery for someTourists enjoy skiing and heli-skiing on the slopes of Gulmarg.Rob, 32, an Australian did not know that there was a place Gulmarg in India. He said he came to know about the ski resort by accident on internet as it was snowing in the area. “I was stunned when I reached here on January 22,” he said. Rob has decided to stay here for a month and do what he likes the most – snowboarding.“I first visited Manali and then stumbled upon this place. I am happy that I did. The experience here has been beyond my imagination. This is the best place for skiing and snowboarding,” said Rob.Rob, an Australian, loves snowboarding and said he discovered about Gulmarg by accident on Internet.

The court has issued notices to the Railway Ministry and the Railway Board on what it called, a “serious and sensitive” issue.The notices were issued after a visually challenged Delhi-based consultant Praveen Kumar filed a PIL that raised this question. The last day for the ministry and the board to file its responses is May 18.Kumar’s lawyer Pankaj Sinha, himself visually challenged, submitted before a bench headed by Chief Justice Dipak Misra and Justice Sanjiv Khanna that “the differentiation was uncalled for.”The Railways justified the denial of e-ticketing facility, saying the electronic reservation slip could be misused by general public by making false claims of disability.But the court prima-facie found the argument untenable. Said Justice Khanna, “... those who avail the disability concession can be asked to produce the handicap certificate after boarding the train.”",1
70,"Henkel goes vegan to revive beauty businessGerman consumer goods company Henkel announced new hair care formulations and brands on Thursday, seeking to tap into consumer demand for more natural ingredients as it tries to revive sluggish growth in its beauty business.Henkel will relaunch its European shampoo brand Schauma with a “vegan” formula, roll out to more markets its Nature Box line of hair and body care products made from cold-pressed oils and launch a new “free-from” hair dye line called OnlyLove.It will also launch a premium vegan brand for professional hair salons called Authentic Beauty Concept and expand its Pro Nature range of cleaning products to include detergents.The move comes as shoppers become more wary of processed chemical ingredients and seek out natural alternatives.Chief Executive Hans van Bylen told a news conference the products certified as vegan will initially address a niche market, but he sees strong potential and said the move will eventually help the company adjust all of its formulations.“The increasing shift towards a green lifestyle and the strong increase in the number of vegans has driven the growing demand for plant-derived ingredients in beauty products,” said Magda Starula, analyst at market data firm Euromonitor.The world’s biggest cosmetics manufacturer L’Oreal bought vegan beauty product firm Logocos Naturkosmetik last year and it has launched its own vegan range, Botanea, sourced from plants found in India.Unilever has also launched a fast-growing hair and body brand called Love Beauty and Planet, that is certified as vegan and cruelty-free.Henkel said the Schauma brand’s vegan formula will not contain silicones or parabens, while the Authentic Beauty Concept line will include “pure” ingredients.Henkel, the maker of Schwarzkopf shampoo and Persil detergent, made the announcement after warning in January that earnings would fall this year as it steps up investment in brands and digital technology to try to revive growth.The company has underperformed rivals like Procter & Gamble Co (P&G) and Unilever in recent years, with underlying sales in its beauty care business falling 0.7 percent in 2018 and the laundry unit growing just 1.9 percent.Henkel’s beauty care unit saw organic sales growth recover to 1 percent in the fourth quarter, but it still lagged behind adhesives and laundry, which grew 2.1 percent and 2.8 percent respectively in the period.Van Bylen said Henkel plans a global relaunch of its Persil brand, with new “four-chamber” detergent pods key to reviving growth in North America, where it is battling P&G for market share.",0
71,"High court admits plea against RPF personnelThe Bombay high court on Thursday admitted a public interest litigation (PIL) which sought a probe by Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) in an alleged scam run by Railway Police Force (RPF) of booking petty offenders in railway offences and then releasing them on fake bail bonds.Observing that prima facie offence was made out against RPF personnel, a division bench of justice BH Marlapalle and justice UD Salvi admitted the petition.The court has also issued notices to the Ministry of Railway and Ministry of Home, Government of India, asking them to file affidavit explaining their stand towards investigation against RPF officials.Public prosecutor Pandurang Pol submitted an affidavit filed by commissioner of police, Railways, which said that their “investigation revealed that offence was committed by RPF personnel on duty Thane Kurla in 2008-09 by using fake bail bonds and false documents and misappropriating the money collected from commuters after charging them with relevant sections under the Railways Act”.Pol also told the court that a special investigation team was formed to probe the alleged scam.The petition was filed by social activist Samir Zaveri alleging a scam relating to cash bonds issued by the RPF personnel at Kurla railway station in 2008-09.It claimed that certain RPF personnel were releasing persons booked for trespassing on fake cash bail bonds. They then asked the commuters to pay Rs 500 bail bonds each in fake courts staged by them. Track trespassing is an offence under section 147 of the Indian Railway Act. A head constable acted as a Magistrate and granted bail to so-called offenders and the money collected was misappropriated by some RPF personnel, the PIL alleged.",1
72,"How an illiterate rickshaw-puller became a mascot for educationAhmed Ali from Assam’s Karimganj district, while pulling his cycle rickshaw one day in the late 1970s, felt miserable at the realization that like him his soon-to-be-born child too will remain illiterate.Ahmed Ali from Assam’s Karimganj district, while pulling his cycle rickshaw one day in the late 1970s, felt miserable at the realization that like him his soon-to-be-born child too will remain illiterate and may have to pull a rickshaw for a living.Hailing from Madhurband village, when Ali, now 82, moved to Karimganj town, about 300 km from Guwahati, he often saw children attending school and getting educated, and sometimes even ferried them to and from their homes to their schools in his rickshaw.The thought of his child not getting proper education hit him so hard that he decided he should do something about it so that poor children of the coming generation, including his own, do not suffer in privation like him.Since then, Ali has gone on to build nine schools and, because of his singular effort, he even found a mention in Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ‘Mann Ki Baat’ radio programme.“I feel it was Allah’s wish and blessings from locals that I could achieve whatever I wanted,” says a humble Ali.“I could not attend school due to poverty. People of my village were poor and it pained me to see the children there were not able to attend schools due to the same reason. I don’t want to see dropouts from poor families any more,” Ali told IANS during a function in Delhi where he was invited as a guest.For establishing the first school, he sold a portion of his land and donated another portion on which the building now stands. The funds for the schools were also arranged by him from his savings, daily earnings and some from charity.“There were some people in the area who supported the cause and helped in whatever way they could,” he said.To ensure there was no fund crisis for the school, he used to pull his rickshaw in the morning and cut wood at night. He sold that wood and used the money to build the school and later to run it.“There was not even a single school in the area. I had this very strong feeling that when my children will be born, they too will not have any school. After the birth of my first child (a boy), the feeling became more strong,” he said.The school, he added, was even more important for girls as “boys get a chance to go out and get an education, but girls do not”.With a firm resolve that he should do something about it, Ali met an education officer, whom he used to ferry in his rickshaw, and with his help, he established a middle school in his village in 1978.“Soon after it was established, I realised that first, we needed a primary school. Until children were educated at the primary level, who will get enrolled in middle school? In 1980, three-LP (Lower Primary) schools were opened,” he said.In all, Ali has opened three lower primary (class I-V) schools, five middle (class VI-VIII) schools and one high school in Madhurband and nearby villages.“Education is an important thing, and everyone should get a chance to get educated. It is a sin for anybody to not be educated,” he said.“Although I may be illiterate, I get respect from people. They now come to seek my blessings. I feel joy when I see that boys and girls from the village have been attending school. This joy inspired me and I never felt tired,” said Ali.“I get satisfaction when girls come and tell me how helpful these schools were for them. Every year, the overall number of girls in schools is higher than boys.”The high school, started in 1990, has 228 students in the current year. Every year, hundreds of students appear for the Class X exams, but they don’t have a place to study further.“I could only manage to make arrangements for students till Class X. They don’t have a place to study Class XI and XII. I need both the government’s approval and funds for setting up the higher-secondary school,” Ali said, in the hope that he will soon accomplish that as well.“There is no nearby college. The nearest college is also 15 km away. I also want to build a college for students, but that will come at a later stage. First we need a junior college (for students passing Class X),” he added.Ali came to limelight in March last year when Prime Minister Modi spoke about him in his monthly “Mann Ki Baat” address.Ali feels proud that the Prime Minister acknowledged his work and he desires to meet Modi.Asked what he will tell Modi, Ali said he wanted all that the schools should be government-recognised so that funds were never an issue. “I will also ask him for a junior college and a college, if possible.”",0
73,"How Kim Jong un went from pariah to guest of honorKim Jong Un’s arrival in Vietnam by train this week for a second meeting with US President Donald Trump may be most remarkable for how normal it’s becoming.Since opening talks with South Korea last year, the once-reclusive North Korean leader has turned into one of the most sought-after guests in Asia. At each stop -- from Beijing to Singapore and now Hanoi -- Kim, 35, is being escorted down red carpets by officials eager to build early ties with the head of one of the world’s last untapped emerging markets.The swing from international pariah to guest of honor is a testament to Kim’s success in wresting power from military chieftains and eliminating rivals since his father died in 2011. It also illustrates his long-held desire to restore an economy drained by decades of famine, state planning and military expansion under his father and grandfather.“If you want to really understand the Kim Jong Un of the present, you have to travel back to his early years,” said Kim Young-hui, who defected from North Korea in 2002 and is now a senior economist at the Korea Development Bank’s Inter-Korean Economic Cooperation Research Unit.He wondered why his father, Kim Jong Il, hadn’t traveled overseas much “and why North Korea was so poor,” she said, citing a book by a Japanese chef who worked for the late dictator. “Kim Jong Un was thinking that when he became the leader, he would run the country a lot better than his reclusive father.”Over the past seven years, the Swiss-educated Kim has steered North Korea from his father’s “military first” policy focused on building a nuclear arsenal to one that emphasizes the economy. After successfully testing an intercontinental ballistic missile in 2017, he declared the weapons program “complete,” initiated talks with Trump and announced a new strategy for boosting the economy.The move ended Trump’s threats of war and paved the way for a historic first meeting with the US president in June. It also opened a new world of potential investors from Seoul to Singapore -- provided Kim can get Trump to relax international sanctions against his weapons program.Trump played down expectations that he might quickly ease pressure on North Korea, telling US governors gathered at the White House on Sunday: “I’m not pushing for speed, but we’re not removing the sanctions.”In recent months, Kim has railed against the sanctions, which do everything from ban travel by officials to curb its energy imports. North Korea ranks as one of the world’s poorest countries and the sanctions are believed to have helped cause the country’s deepest recession in two decades in 2017, according to South Korean estimates.“When they come to negotiations, it means they are having a tough time internally due to sanctions and Kim feels nervous,” said Thae Yong-ho, who was North Korea’s deputy ambassador to the UK before defecting in 2016 and becoming a critic of the regime.Kim left Pyongyang on Saturday afternoon on a train that will take him through China down to Vietnam. He traveled abroad five times last year -- more than any North Korean leader in at least two decades -- often visiting industrial sites. Kim reportedly plans to do the same in Vietnam ahead of the planned summit, giving him a close-up view of a fellow socialist state that has prospered after easing hostility with the US.North Korean officials have been spotted near Samsung Electronics Co.’s smartphone plants in Vietnam, the Yonhap News Agency reported last week, suggesting Kim may tour South Korean factories. While South Korea is Vietnam’s second-largest trading partner, a North Korean leader hasn’t visited Vietnam since Kim’s grandfather, Kim Il Sung, in 1964.Trump himself has repeatedly cited Kim’s development goals while arguing why North Korea would trade its nuclear arsenal away.“Chairman Kim realizes, perhaps better than anyone else, that without nuclear weapons, his country could fast become one of the great economic powers anywhere in the World,” Trump tweeted on Sunday. “Because of its location and people (and him), it has more potential for rapid growth than any other nation!”Kim hasn’t secured his control over North Korea by showing weakness. His reign has been marked by ruthless purges and executions, including the killing of his uncle and one-time deputy, Jang Song Thaek, as well as the murder of his older half-brother, Kim Jong Nam.That consolidation of power has given him the space to introduce economic and government reforms once seen as nearly impossible in the insular, one-party state. And it’s allowed him to shake hands with Trump, the leader of a country that North Korean propaganda has spent generations blaming for all of its problems.Even now, the purges appear to be continuing. Kim exiled, imprisoned or executed 50 to 70 members of the country’s political elite last year, including opponents of engagement with the US, according to a report published last week by the North Korea Strategy Center, a Seoul-based research institution founded by a former defector.“Kim Jong Un has been very skillful in rewarding the friendly, co-opting the neutral and punishing the hostile,” said Moon Chung-in, special adviser on foreign policy to South Korean President Moon Jae-in, said in an interview earlier this month. “His longevity is institutionally guaranteed. But at the same time he’s good at consolidating power.”Kim now needs to show the elite back in Pyongyang that his engagement efforts can bring economic opportunity without sacrificing the country’s nuclear deterrent -- its “treasured sword.” The regime has a long history of coming to the bargaining table dangling the prospect of cooperation, only to renege on deals after extracting economic concessions.Chun Yungwoo, former chief South Korean envoy to international nuclear negotiations with North Korea, said Kim’s successful consolidation of power requires him to consider what kind of country he wants to rule over for the next 40 to 50 years.“He wants to have a more prosperous country -- he wants economic development,” Chun said. “Without giving up nuclear weapons, all he can do is maintain a subsistence-level economy.”",0
74,"How railways put men at 11 level crossings a day Indian railways did away with at least 11 of its thousands of unmanned level crossings every day during the past 10 months to eliminate these death traps. The last such crossing on broad-gauge lines was converted into a gated one in Allahabad on Thursday, the same day railway minister Piyush Goyal confirmed in his budget speech that these unmanned crossings were a thing of the past. According to railway ministry officials, an accident on April 16, 2018 involving a school van at such a crossing on Kaptanganj-Thawe section in UP that claimed 13 lives was the turning point for putting the focus on quickly doing away with these crossings. “The ministry had told the Parliament these crossings would be a thing of past by March 2020. But work on a war footing was undertaken to complete the task earlier after the accident,” said an official. The number of accidents at unmanned level crossings has been at an all-time low at only three during this fiscal as compared to 65 in 2009-10. Sources said in most of the cases either mechanised or manual system of operating gates have been operationalised to stop vehicles from crossing the tracks when trains go past these spots. They added at some crossing, they have route relay interlocking system where the rail traffic flow is highe Officials said the railways had zeroed down on four models to eliminate the crossings including merger with another level crossing by constructing diversion road, construction of subway or rail under bridge and manning. The last option was found to be most cost effective and less time taking. Building rail under and over bridges often require land acquisition and other permissions.",1
75,"Huawei says Mate X’s India launch depends on 5G availability, no plans for 4G?variantPowered by the company’s Kirin 980 processor, the Huawei Mate X comes with a 6.6-inch dual display panel and offers a FullView display.Dashing hopes of Indian consumers willing to acquire the just-released foldable phone from Huawei any time soon, the company says it is not planning to bring a 4G version of the Mate X shortly and that its availability will depend on the 5G network in the country.Although India is targeting 2020 for 5G roll-out, the country is yet to allocate 5G spectrum to operators even for 5G trial of use cases.Expensive at 2,299 euros (about Rs 1,85,000), the foldable Mate X is a 5G phone and as the US has been raising security concerns over use of Huawei 5G equipment, the European market could be the first to see the release of the phone.Huawei showcased the foldable phone at Mobile World Congress (MWC), Barcelona, on Sunday, but did not allow the visiting journalists to touch the device.“We expect to start shipping the device form the middle of this year through the carrier channel. Making the device available in the open market may take some time,” Kevin Ho, President of the Handset Business, Huawei Consumer Business Group, told IANS here.Replying to a question about producing foldable phone for the 4G network, he said that although the company was not focusing on bringing a 4G to suit markets like India, it could consider such a proposal at a later stage.Powered by the company’s Kirin 980 processor, the Huawei Mate X comes with a 6.6-inch dual display panel and offers a FullView display.It houses massive 4,500 mAH dual battery and several industry-first features, including a new superfast charging capability that can reach 85 per cent battery in just 30 minutes.The phone features a flexible OLED panel and a falcon wing mechanical hinge.“Creating the foldable phone’s hinge is the most challenging part for our engineers,” Ho said. “We had to design the hinge to avoid layers like formation that one gets when one folds a book or a notebook. This was a big challenge and they had to use a sophisticated technology,” he added.While Ho asserted that the phone was ready for mass production, he acknowledged that the company was still doing several tests and was also in talks with app developers so that apps can be optimised for a foldable device.The 8GB + 512 GB phone, which can be easily unfolded at the click of a button, now has only one colour, Interstellar Blue, and comes with a full protection case. Huawei said it might introduce new colours for the device at a later stage.When unfolded, the 6.6-inch dual display panel transforms into an 8-inch tablet only 5.4mm thick.While unveiling the device on Sunday at a packed hall here, Huawei Consumer Business Group CEO Richard Yu claimed that the phone offers best selfie camera. But the company did not reveal the camera specifications.“The phone will provide users more privacy and security protection,” he said.“Today, many carriers are using NSA (non-standalone) architecture, working together with 4G. But the future of 5G is SA (standalone) architecture.“Mate X is the only phone now with the capability to work in both the architecture. So this phone is not only for today, but also for future 5G,” Yu noted.Ho parried questions on security concerns raised by countries like the US which accuse Huawei of passing on data to the Chinese government.“We don’t want to talk about it today. We want to focus on technology and our new products today,” he said.",0

No casualty was reported.The crash happened barely 15 minutes after it took off from Gorakhpur air base along with two other Jaguars for routine exercise.Panic-stricked locals rushed to the site of the burning wreckage in large numbers, Kushinagar district magistrate Anil Kumar said.An eyewitness said they saw the aircraft explode in flames in the sky before hitting the ground with a bang while the pilot landed in a sandy area close to the river bed.“Two other such planes continued to hover in sky when the aircraft crashed. The strong winds intensified the flames of the burning plane and soon it was reduced to ashes,” said another eyewitness.On being informed by locals, police and administration officials, including DM Kumar and senior superintendent of police (SSP) Rajeev Mishra, rushed to the accident site with rescue teams and fire tenders, while an air force chopper airlifted the injured pilot to Gorakhpur airbase where he was admitted for treatment of minor injuries on his back.While the cause of the crash is not known, a court of inquiry has been ordered by Gorakhpur air force officials.Speaking on phone, wing commander Prayagraj air force station, Arvind Sinha, said: “An inquiry has been ordered to look in to the reason of the mishap.”The district magistrate said “the pilot showed courage and presence of mind by diverting the plane away from populated area towards the Chhoti Gandak river but it crashed midway in a field after catching fire. He saved his life by jumping off the plane when it was just about 150 metres from the crash site. He is fine and undergoing treatment at Gorakhpur air force hospital”.",0

78,"Illegal shrines derail centre’s multi-modal terminal project in VaranasiThe National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government’s plan to set up a so-called multi-modal terminal which provides rail, road and waterways connectivity in Varanasi , Uttar Pradesh has run into trouble because of places of worship that have been illegally constructed on the land meant for the project.“Land has been an issue in this project. There are certain sensitivities; there are three mosques and four temples on the railway land on which we want to build the terminal,” a senior official at the ministry of road transport said requesting anonymity. This person added that the ministry doesn’t want to push things on this front because demolishing places of worship could become a contentious issue ahead of the next year’s parliamentary polls.The proposed terminal at Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s constituency is part of the Jal Marg Vikas Project (JMVP, a Rs 5,369 crore World Bank aided project on the Ganga, aimed at augmenting the navigational capacity of the Varanasi to Haldia stretch of the river, to enable commercial navigation of at least 1500-2000 ton vessels).The land in question belongs to the Railways which leased it out to National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) for construction of a bus and a railway terminal.“This is railways’ land and has been given to the NHAI on an ‘as is where is’ basis and they were to further develop that land. The issue is that on some of the land there are mosques and temples. They are unable to find a way to remove them. So i don’t think that project will be able to go forward,” a senior official at ministry of railway said on condition for anonymity.The government had awarded the contract to AFCONS Infrastructure for the construction of phase I of the Multi-Modal Terminal at Varanasi for Rs 170 crore.“ Railways land is usually very old, this one must be around 150 years old hence we don’t know when or how these structures were built they assume that they have been built in the last 20 years. The land is around 100 acres big. We had handed over the rights of the land to NHAI about two months ago,” the railways official said.The Detailed Project Report (DPR) of the construction of the project was prepared by NHAI. It involved building a multi-modal terminal including a railway station and a bus terminal. The land is situated at Kashi station in Varanasi. “There is no easy solution to such sensitive issues. The basic issue is that before construction has to happen it is important to remove these places of worship. NHAI has asked the civil administration to look into it but they also have their own compulsion since this happens to be a sensitive religious issue,” the railway ministry official added.The project has been caught up in land related issues since its inception. Another piece of land near the proposed water terminal couldn’t be acquired initially.“We had some issues which were finally sorted out. There was a group of ‘Hindu Mahants’ who had ownership of the land and they argued that they would not vacate this till the government gave them another plot in the same area, which also was disputed. Officials and state had to get involved to resolve it,” a senior official at the ministry of shipping said.Union minister for road transport, highways and shipping Nitin Gadkari laid the foundation stone for the terminal at Varanasi in August, 2016. The ministry is now considering changing its plans. “There are many land related issues in this project. There was also a small patch of land which was allotted and leased to some trust and now the trust claims to own the land. There are issues with some religious structures. So we are looking at whether it is feasible to overcome this or adjust the entire layout of the multi-modal hub, “ the road ministry official said.Under JMVP, three multi-modal terminals are being constructed at Varanasi, Sahibganj and Haldia. The total financial progress for the project at the end of 2017-18 was ~678.85 crore or 13.05%. JMVP is scheduled to be completed by December, 2022.According to officials at the ministry of shipping and the IWAI, the government is keen to get the water terminal inaugurated by PM in November. According to IWAI, nearly 85% of the work has been completed for the water terminal. The agency added that all issues related to land have been addressed. “The project construction is going on schedule without any hindrances,” IWAI said.",1

80,"In Gorakhpur rally, PM Modi set the tone for Lok Sabha poll battle in PurvanchalPrime Minister Narendra Modi has set the pitch for a fierce poll battle in Purvanchal region (east UP) with the announcement of the launch of Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN) as well as Rs 10,000-crore development projects for the region on Sunday.Aware of the importance of 31 Lok Sabha seats of east UP that will be crucial in regaining power at the Centre, Modi said the NDA government had launched several development and welfare schemes to give thrust to development in the region.“The projects will pave way for development of Purvanchal that remained neglected under the Congress, Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) and the Samajwadi Party (SP) governments,” he said.The prestige of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) will be at stake as its top leaders, including PM Narendra Modi, Kalraj Mishra, Manoj Sinha, Varun Gandhi, Mahendra Nath Pandey and UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath come from this region.In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the BJP had swept this region by grabbing all the seats except Azamgarh that went into the SP’s kitty. The Congress won two while the BSP failed to open its account.As the BJP plans to bag maximum seats from the region, various development and welfare schemes have been announced during public meetings in PM’s Lok Sabha constituency Varanasi, located on the southern tip of Purvanchal, and Gorakhpur that is located in the north.With the SP-BSP combine and the Congress also shifting their focus on Purvanchal, the BJP is going all out to win maximum support from the region.The SP-BSP alliance has shared equal number of seats in Purvanchal to give a tough fight to BJP.Once a strong fort of alliance partners, the BJP made inroads into their vote base in the 2014 Lok Sabha election.SP leader Shivram Yadav said, “Riding on Dalit-Backwards-Muslim formula, the alliance hopes to check the BJP.”The Congress has appointed Priyanka Gandhi Vadra as its general secretary for east UP. The region had played a major role in the formation of UPA government in 2004 and 2009 Lok Sabha elections.In 2014, Congress was wiped out in Purvanchal which was its stronghold since Independence.Congress has also appointed three secretaries – Zubair Khan, Kumar Ashish and Bajirao Khade – to assist Priyanka in the battle of ballot. The party plans to win over upper castes, Dalits and Muslims that were its traditional vote base.That the BJP is concerned over the SP-BSP alliance as well as Congress’s Purvanchal plan can be gauged from the fact that during their address both the PM as well as the CM highlighted the government’s development schemes and attacked the opposition parties.Modi said the BJP government strengthened health facilities in the region, restarted fertiliser factory, electrified rail routes, started manufacturing of railway engine in Varanasi and Gorakhpur to pave way for prosperity in the area.Political analyst AK Mishra said, “To retain the BJP’s hold on Purvanchal region, Modi launched PM-KISAN Scheme in Gorakhpur. Purvanchal region is the agriculture hub of the state and the support of farmers will play a decisive role in elections. The SP-BSP alliance is working on caste equations to win the election while Congress is depending on the magic of Priyanka Gandhi. Besides YogiModi charisma, BJP is playing Purvanchal development card to win the election.”",0
81,"In the next 3-4 years, all trains will run fast and on time’Manish Anand , said that his ministry would soon move the Union Cabinet for approval of “government-to-government” partnerships with foreign countries, a step beyond the concept of foreign direct investment.We saw big-ticket FDI investment in the railway workshop projects at Madhepura and Mahraura in Bihar to the tune of Rs 40,000 crore. What would be the next big FDI investment in the railways We have seen massive interest from a number of countries in the modernisation of our railway stations. South Korea has already submitted its model of redevelopment of the New Delhi railway station. South Korea is ready with a proposal to invest as much as Rs 8,000 crore in the modernisation of the New Delhi railway station. The model is with us, which will be a complete gamechanger as far as a railway station is seen. France is keen to redevelop the Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus in Mumbai. The French are also working for the re-development of Ludhiana station. In the coming times, we will see major FDI inflow into the railway sector.You have been to Germany, France, Japan and many other countries. The railways appear to have become India’s engagement with foreign countries. What can we expect from these countries in the railways We are soon going to the Union Cabinet for approval to enter into “government-to-government” (G-G) investment (agreements). We are ready to sign agreements with as many as 14 countries. They are ready to partner with Indian Railways to make their governments partners in the progress of the railways. Among the 14 countries are Japan, China, Germany, Czechoslovakia, South Korea, France and the United Arab Emirates. G-G investment is better than FDI for the railways because here we do not have to worry about the involvement of private players. The money will come from the government of the partner country. In the coming years, we are going to witness massive G-G investment in the railways. Japan alone is going to invest close to $25 billion in Indian Railways, besides the bullet train project.After commissioning the semi-high-speed rail between New Delhi and Agra, what progress can we expect on speeding up the railways We are going to offer one semi-high-speed route each to the 14 countries with which we are soon going to operationalise the G-G investment model. These countries will build the infrastructure and Indian Railways will integrate them into the existing system. Thus, we can have a large number of semi-high-speed rail networks getting commissioned at the same time; this can change the very face of the railways and the country in the next four to five years.We already are holding trials of the Spanish semi-high-speed Talgo trains. It’s a matter of a few weeks in which we will know the full details of the claims being made by Talgo. Once we get the details, we will take the next course of action.The Bibek Debroy Committee on the restructuring of the Railway Board was constituted soon after the Narendra Modi government came to power. Many more committees have in the past submitted reports. What is being done about their reports So far we have already implemented almost 90 per cent of the recommendations of the Bibek Debroy Committee. We have constituted two cross-functional directorates for non-tariff revenue and mobility, which will directly report to the chairman, Railway Board. We have already delegated powers to the general managers and divisional railway managers. Soon we will sign a memorandum of understanding with the zonal railways in which we will ensure their functional autonomy. Thus, much of the desired outcomes of the various committees have been implemented so far, and much more will be done. Very soon we are also going to establish the rail tariff authority. We are currently examining the legislative and non-legislative components of the proposed authority.In the beginning of the coming to power of the Modi government, we heard much talk about the lateral entry of professionals in government departments. Is the idea still alive We are soon going to induct 100 interns from outside the railways who would become part of the organisation. We are keen to take outside professionals, and the cross-functional directorates would look to benefit from their talent pool.With a soft loan from Japan in place for the bullet train project between Ahmedabad and Mumbai, the popular perception persists that such investment should have come in for existing railway infrastructure. There is a place for a five-star hotel in an economy and similarly a bullet train project too is important for the country. In our economy we have five-star hotels where we do not expect the common man to go. We are not going to invest anything in the bullet train project. The money is coming from Japan. But we will gain from the induction of technology, the safety standards, the capacity to execute big-ticket projects, besides the huge spin-off effect on the economy by spending such a huge sum of money in the country.When are we going to see the fruits of the investment being made in capacity augmentation by the railways, which has been the priority of your two projects In the last financial year we commissioned 2,828 km of new lines, broad gauge conversion and doubling. In the next two years we will add almost 7,000 km of such lines. We are going to invest close to Rs 45,000 crore in the next two years for such projects. By 2019, we hope to commission the twin dedicated freight corridors between Dadri and JNPT, Mumbai and Ludhiana-Kolkata. With their commissioning, much of the tracks will be available for running of trains and will also allow us to time-table the goods trains. In the next three to four years trains will not only run on time, but fast and tickets would also be available on demand",1

85,"Indian Railways And Facilities Provided To The PublicIn the entire world, Indian railways has gained the position of being the largest public system of passengers transport. About 7500 trains for passengers are run by Indian railways carrying 12 million people on an average every day. The first train was run in 1853 from Mumbai’s Victoria Terminals to Thane. A British engineer Robert Maitland Brereton was responsible for the expansion of railways from the year 1857 onwards. Indian Railways is world’s seventh largest utility employer with over 1,376 million employees. As for rolling stock Indian Railways holds over 2,45,267 freights wagons, 66,392 passenger coaches and 10,499 locomotives and runs 12,617 passenger trains and 7421 freight trains daily. Indian Railways earn about 70 per cent of its revenues from freight traffic so majority of its profits come from freight and this makes up for losses on passengers fares low it cross-subsidises the loss making passenger traffic with the profit making freight traffic. However its share in freight traffic is much lower than road traffic. This should be looked into and rational approach for fixing fares for goods trains and passenger trains. Railways has two UNESCO world heritage sites namely the Chatrapari Shivaji Terminus and the mountain railways of India. But, this huge organisation is running in losses of Rs. 30, 000 crores in the passenger segment for the year ending March 2014. As in the practise of railway ministry, new railway line projects are announced during the railway budget each year, without securing additional funding for them. In the last 12 years 99 new line projects worth Rs. 60,000 crores were announced out of which only one project is complete till date while four projects that are as old as 30 years, but are still not complete. This practise of announcing new railway line projects needs a serious approach and should not be announced without proper sanction of budget is there. The passenger facilities like waiting rooms and retiring rooms, needs a serious and practical approach. The passenger associations and railway employees must be consulted on regular basis. Often there are no proper electricity connections for charging mobile phones and they are over crowded. Most of the major railway stations have these waiting rooms, but one cannot be sure of their presence in all stations across India. Retiring rooms are there in larger and important railway stations. Retiring rooms can be basic rooms or dormitory or suits. But these retiring or waiting rooms lack recommended amenities. The railway ministry must pay attention to them rather than to announce new railway line, which may not come without provision of funding.",1

A release from ISMA said: ""As on 15th February, 2019, 507 sugarNSE 14.71 % mills in the country have produced 219.30 lakh tonnes of sugar, as compared to 203.55 lakh tonnes produced by 494 mills on the corresponding date last year. Higher production this year is mainly because Maharashtra and Karnataka sugar mills started their crushing earlier this year. Overall, the country is expected to produce less sugar this season as compared to last season."" According to ISMA, in Maharashtra, sugar production till 15th February 2019 was 82.98 lakh tonnes, compared with 74.74 lakh tonnes produced last year same period. In the current 2018-19 SS, 6 mills have closed their crushing operations in the State while 187 sugar mills are operating, as against 183 mills operated last year on the corresponding date. Due to early start of mills in Maharashtra, the mills therein are expected to close earlier than last year, especially when the sugar production from Maharashtra will be less than last year. In U.P. 117 sugar mills are in operation and they have produced 63.93 lakh tonnes of sugar till 15th February 2019, compared with 64.54 lakh tonnes produced by 119 mills on the corresponding date of last year. The sugar recovery achieved this season is about 0.77% more than what was achieved so far during the last season, but the yield per hectare is lower than last year, because of which the total production in U.P. will be less than last year.In case of Karnataka, till 15th February, 2019, mills have produced 38.74 lakh tonnes of sugar, 10 mills have closed their operations in the State while 57 mills are in operation. During the corresponding period last year, 52 mills had produced 30.73 lakh tonnes sugar. In case of Tamil Nadu, 33 sugar mills are in operation and have produced 3.50 lakh tonnes of sugar, as compared to 2.90 lakh tonnes produced by 28 sugar mills in 2017-18 SS on the corresponding date. Gujarat has produced 7.78 lakh tonnes of sugar till 15th February 2019 with 16 sugar mills in operation. Last year, 17 sugar mills were in operation and they had produced 7.25 lakh tonnes of sugar on the same date. In Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, 24 sugar mills have produced 4.50 lakh tonnes as on 15th February 2019, as compared to 4.60 lakh tonnes produced by 23 sugar mills on the corresponding date last season. In Bihar, Uttarakhand, Punjab, Haryana and Madhya Pradesh & Chhattisgarh, sugar production till 15th February 2019 has been in the order of 4.90 lakh tonnes,2.15 lakh tonnes, 3.75 lakh tonnes, 3.60 lakh tonnes and 3.20 lakh tonnes, respectively.

At least 200 have been injured.Sources said the probe team was also looking into allegations that the two loco pilots — Janak Sharma and Pramesh Purohit — were drunk at the time of the accident. Sharma, Purohit and train guard Ajay Srivastava appeared before the inquiry panel headed by rail safety (eastern railways) commissioner PK Acharya on Tuesday to record their statements. “Blood samples of the pilots were taken and sent for medical examination. The report hasn’t come yet,” said Acharya.The panel summoned 41 railway employees of different departments in Jhansi railway division for their written statement. Some people, mostly passengers, also came to record their statements.The panel will record statements of people and railway personnel for two days but the period can be extended. The inquiry report will be submitted within a month to the Railways ministry.Railway men mostly stuck to the version that there was no problem with the train. Gate man Ravindra Paswan, who was at gate no 197 at the time of the mishap, said in his deposition before the panel that the train was moving at normal speed and there was no issue with it.However, Ishwar Dass, another railway employee, said when the train passed his point at 3.01am, it left the overhead wires dangling, indicating that it was running at high speed.

89,"International Conference On Decarbonization Of Indian Railways- Mission Electrification Begins TodayMinistry of Railways through Institution of Railways Electrical Engineer (IREE) in partnership with ASSOCHAM India is organising the International Conference on Decarbonization of Indian Railways- Mission Electrification today. Member Traction, Railway Board Ashwani Kumar Kapoor briefed about this conference and gave following information:-An International Conference on “Decarbonization of Indian Railways – Mission Electrification” is being organized in New Delhi on 3rd Nov.’16.The Conference aims at bringing various stakeholders on a common platform for exchange of ideas and to deliberate on implementable technological solutions and financing options to significantly increase pace of electrification and achieve the target for setting up of renewable energy installations with total capacity of 1000MW by 2020.The Conference will also project Indian Railways as an attractive investment destination considering its plans for huge investment in next 5 years towards modernization of its electrified network and use of renewable energy.The Conference shall cover aspects relating to policy, technological modernization, mechanization, innovations and financing models for railway electrification and de-carbonization. National Transport Development Policy Committee (NTDPC), in its report, has identified electrification of railway tracks as a means to reduce fuel consumption. The report has recommended for taking up electrification on priority through systematically tackling the bottlenecks in progress of electrification projects. It has also suggested that electrification should be viewed as a means of making rail transport independent of imported fossil energy, while also provide a choice in sourcing energy. Moreover, electric traction allows regeneration of power while braking/coasting and feeding the network, thereby reducing overall consumption of energy and carbon emissions. In this regard, following action has been planned for improving efficiency and bringing in cost economies in freight and passenger operations. Reducing the Carbon Foot prints through use of sustainable and green sources of energy is also a key focus area.In line with this vision, following action plan has been planned: Electrification of Railway TracksCurrently 28,000 rkm of tracks are electrified (42% of the total network) carrying around two-thirds of total freight traffic and 50% of total passenger traffic. As against 800 kms of average electrification in the earlier years, 1600 rkm of railway tracks were electrified in 2015-16. To fast track the pace of electrification, Ministry of Railway would be involving PSUs like IRCON, RITES and PGCIL. Increase in the pace of electrification will reduce its fuel bill by Rs. 10,000 cr. annually as against the business as usual approach. Harnessing Renewable Energy on IR to reduce energy cost and carbon footprints Indian Railways targets to harness 1 GW solar and 500 MW wind power as announced in Rail Budget 2015-’16, 500 MW of solar units on roof tops through Central Finance Assistance (CFA) from MNRE and balance 500 MW on land.",1

91,"Is it curtains for Congress' Bansal?One could hear a pin drop at former railway minister and Congress candidate Pawan Bansal's residence at Sector 28 on Friday afternoon, as it became clear that the Chandigarh MP for the last three times in a row will lose the seat. As it later transpired, he lost by 69,642 votes, the highest-ever for the city, polling 1,21, 720 votes.The day started as usual for him as he rose even before sunrise, at around 5:30am. A quick shower and prayer followed by a cup of tea was what it took for him to be ready to accept the people's verdict, and as the day wore on, he looked increasingly downcast. The handful of supporters that had gathered before counting began also dwindled away as the trends that showed him trailing trickled in.So, as Bansal with wife Madhu visited the counting centre at around 9:30am and was back in half an hour, the writing was on the wall and the deserted Congress office in Sector 35 said it all.It is clear that the Railgate, the infighting within the party, the anti-incumbency against the UPA, the nation-wide Modi wave and the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) factors combined led to the defeat of the four-time parliamentarian.With the Congress suffering a humiliating defeat across the country and Bansal losing, in what was his bastion, is it curtains on the political career of the veteran political leader?Bansal, who had held important positions in the UPA-1 and UPA-11 including the parliamentary affairs ministry and the railway ministry, will be without any work now as HT brings you the reasons for the loss.Less than expected votes from coloniesAs more than half of the 6.13 lakh voters were from colonies and villages and the turnout here had always been high, Bansal had expected a sizeable number of votes. He probably failed to hold ground here against the Modi wave. The BJP's focus on highlighting the Railgate, where his nephew was caught by the CBI accepting `90 lakh for a posting, when he was the railway minister, probably influenced the voters. AAP candidate Gul Panag also took away some of these votes.",1

95,"Kangana Ranaut attacks Manikarnika co-director Krish after NTR biopic’s failure, says time to question ‘every vulture’Kangana Ranaut has criticised Manikarnika co-director Krrish as his NTR biopic failed to perform at the box office, saying ‘now is the time to question every vulture who was out for my blood’.Actor Kangana Ranaut has constantly been in headlines for her film Manikarnika: The Queen of Jhansi which eventually entered the Rs 100 crore club at the domestic box office. Earlier, co-director Krish had accused the actor of hijacking the film and a bitter exchange of words had followed the film’s release. Krish had reportedly left Manikarnika to direct the NTR biopic titled NTR Mahanayakudu, which failed at the box office.This has now given the actor one more reason to criticise the filmmaker. On being asked about the same, Kangana told Pinkvilla, “Yes, I also read about zero recovery of NTR, it’s called black mark on the actor’s career. My heart goes out to Balakrishna sir who trusted Krish and put so much at stake, but for me now is the time to question every vulture who was out for my blood, who attacked and harassed me for taking charge of a troubled situation and making a critically acclaimed and commercially successful film (Manikarnika), but what is shameful is that Krish and some paid media ran a sabotage campaign against a martyr’s biopic. Honestly, I am embarrassed of them, our freedom fighters gave blood for some thankless fools.”The actor was part of several controversies and had accused Bollywood celebrities of not supporting her during the film’s release. It seems she has finally found support in senior actors including Anupam Kher and Paresh Rawal who have slammed people on social media for making fun of a behind-the-scene video featuring Kangana on a mechanical horse during the shooting of battle scenes for Manikarnika.While her sister Rangoli had spoken up in her defence and justified how an actor’s close-up is shot just like all Bollywood and Hollywood films, now Paresh Rawal and Anupam Kher have come out in her support.Paresh Rawal took to Twitter to justify Rangoli’s stand and sharing how scenes are shot with the help of special effects. He tweeted, “According to these dimwits and pinheads they believe that superman and Batman in Hollywood films are actually flying and it’s not some camera trick or CG effects ...!”Anupam had earlier called out a user for criticising Kangana for not using a real horse to shoot some battle scenes. He had tweeted, “How much venom this man has against a self made actress #KanganaRanaut!! This is called ‘acting’ idiot. Actors all over the world do that. That is their job. She will be remembered for decades for her hard work in movies. While you got your fifteen minute fame by using her name.”Earlier, co-director Krish had accused the actor of hijacking the film and a bitter exchange of words had followed the film’s release. Kangana had earlier called out Alia Bhatt and Aamir Khan for not supporting her films, claiming she always does the same for others. Kangana said while she attended the screenings of Dangal, Secret Superstar and Raazi, Alia and Aamir did not return the favour.According to a report in Pinkvilla, Kangana said she made a phonecall to Alia and told her to ‘grow a spine’. She said, “I suggested that she (Alia) grows some spine and support an important film about woman empowerment and nationalism....if she doesn’t have a voice of her own and her existence is all about being KJo (Karan Johar) puppet then I don’t consider her successful... I told her if she is only focusing on earning bucks and not raise a voice, then her success has no value.... hope she understands the true meaning of success and her responsibilities, Napo gang life is simply restricted to give and take favours hope she rises above that.”",0

The two also admitted to have been in touch with Pulwama attack mastermind Abdul Rasheed Ghazi who was killed in an encounter with the security forces five days after the CRPF convoy was attacked on February 14. Investigators also claim to have obtained voice messages from the cellphone of one of the two youths—Shahnawaz Teli of Kulgam and Abdul Aqib Mallick of Pulwama—in which he is heard talking about some “ bada kaam” (something big) and “ samaan” (goods). Investigators said the conversation apparently relates to a major operation that the two were planning and “ samaan” was used for weapons or explosives. The two accused reportedly confessed to their links with the JeM during their interrogation by director general of police (DGP) OP Singh, who spent four hours questioning them for a first-hand assessment of their involvement in terror activities.

The excluded professionals include doctors, engineers, lawyers, chartered accountants and architects registered with professional bodies, the agriculture ministry said in the operational guidelines for the Pradhan Mantri KIsan SAmman Nidhi (PM-KISAN) scheme announced in the interim budget on February 1. The government will not cover those with a monthly pension of Rs 10,000 or more. The scheme promises to pay Rs 6,000 a year in three instalments to farmers who own up to 2 hectares of land, with the first instalment due for the period from December 1 to March 31. States have been given a deadline of February 25 to submit lists of eligible farmers. The cut-off date for eligible farmers is February 1 of this year, after which new owners of agricultural land won’t be considered for the next five years. “However, benefit will be allowed in those cases where transfer of ownership of cultivable land takes place on account of succession due to death of the landowner,” according to a document on the website of the Department of Agriculture Cooperation & Farmers Welfare. An alternative mechanism will be set up for the northeast, where land ownership is often community based, making it difficult to select eligible famers. The mechanism for eligibility of northeast farmers will be developed and approved by a committee of Union ministers from the Ministry of Development of North East Region (DoNER), Ministry of Land Resources, Agriculture Minister and the state chief ministers or their ministerial representative, based on the proposal by the northeast states concerned. The Centre has asked the states to identify and designate a sponsoring bank for this scheme. “States may consider designating the same bank being used for transfer of fund for MNRGES as sponsoring bank for this scheme,” it said. It said the designated bank should have well-developed IT systems with the capabilities of integration with the web portal of the scheme and Public FinancialManagement System (PFMS).",0

Sharma counts himself as one of them.“The Trans bill is the single biggest mistake of the [ruling] BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party],” he said. “If it is passed, it will make life very difficult for us.” The bill, however, was not taken up by the Rajya Sabha during the final session of Parliament.Sharma, who identifies as a transman, cannot get a voter ID card made, because, in a conundrum that is peculiar to the transgender community, he does not have “proof” of his gender identity. The two identifying documents that he possesses, the Aadhaar card and PAN (Permanent Account Number) card, are in the female gender he was assigned at birth. “I am not making a voter ID card right now because I know that it will be difficult to change the gender and name on it. First I’ll get my Aadhaar and PAN card corrected, and then I’ll get all these made.” Does he know what needs to be done? “Yes, main aapko batata hoon (let me tell you about it),” he said, narrating the procedure. When will he do it? Soon, he replies.",0
102,"Lok Sabha elections 2019: BJP to go it alone in HaryanaThe Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) would go it alone in Haryana in the forthcoming Lok Sabha elections, party’s co-incharge for parliamentary polls in the state, Vishwas Sarang, said.Sarang, who was in Kurukshetra on Saturday to attend a workshop of party workers from Kurukshetra, Karnal, Ambala and Sonepat Lok Sabha constituencies, said the decision about party candidates would be taken by the party’s central leadership after discussion with state leaders.Exuding confidence that the BJP would win all the 10 Lok Sabha seats in Haryana, Sarang said the results of Jind assembly byelection had proved that opposition parties, especially the Congress, had lost ground in the state.He, however, parried question on why the BJP had not taken action against Kurukshetra MP Raj Kumar Saini, who has formed a separate party.Earlier, addressing party workers in the Kurukshetra University’s auditorium, chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar said Prime Minister Narendra Modi will address 11 crore party workers in the country on February 28. BJP’S national president Amit Shah would hold a meeting of party workers at Hisar on February 25 and on March 2, a bike rally would be taken out in every assembly constituency of the state, he said.Without taking any name, Khattar alleged that many Congress leaders were facing corruption cases. “Leaders alone cannot be blamed for corruption. Government officers and employees also play an equal role,” he added.“But we have managed to eliminate corruption, ”the CM said.Khattar and BJP’S Haryana in-charge Anil Jain also launched a mobile app of ‘Digital BJP Haryana’ on the occasion.",0
103,"Maha-­Metro faces land acquisition hurdles in old Pune or ‘peth’ areasMaharashtra Metro Rail Corporation Ltd (Maha-Metro) is facing opposition from residents in the old Pune or ‘peth’ areas for acquiring land for construction of Metro stations at Budhwar peth and Mandai.Maha-Metro had already identified 322 entities whose properties will need to be acquired in these areas for carrying out the construction work. Brijesh Dixit, managing director, Maha-Metro said, “It is natural to face opposition for land acquisition. No one is willing to give their property. However, the government needs to acquire the lands to complete the projects in the larger interest.”Dixit said there are 205 Metros working in the world and all of them face similar problems when it comes to land acquisition. However, Maha-Metro is planning to give “good compensation” to the project affected people and is keeping all options open such as giving cash component or alternate property at another location, and TDR (transfer of development rights) for handing over the properties.“This is a crowed area and Maha-Metro will need these properties for erecting the metro stations. The metro corridors will not need land acquisition,” he said.The affected properties have been surveyed by Maha-Metro with the help of third party as well its project officials. The authorities have also assured to rehabilitate the affected people in the same locality. PMC has one plot in the city area which can be developed and all the affected families can be rehabilitated in the same locality, he said.Dixit said Maha Metro will ensure that no injustice would be done to anyone during the land acquisition process.Railway ministry gives approvalAfter defence ministry, the railway ministry has given its approval for crossings over railway lines on the Pune Metro route and connectivity with Khadki, Shivajinagar and Pune stations.Brijesh Dixit, managing director, maharashtra metro rail corporation said, “Pune is lucky as it is getting speedy permissions for the Metro project. After the defence ministry’s recent nod to hand over 10 acres land at Khadki, Dapodi and Range Hills, the railway ministry has given its approval for crossing the railway lines near Kamgar Putala and connecting of metro stations with railway stations at Khadki, Shivajinagar and Pune Railway station.The defence ministry has cleared the Pune Metro right of way permission as also the land transfer proposal for Metro stations,” he said.The Maha Metro’s Pimpri-Chinchwad to Swargate Metro corridor is passing from the Khadki Cantonment area for which defence land is required for parking and construction of railway stations at Khadki, Dapodi and at Range Hills. Land is also required from the defence ministry for erecting the metro corridor of 1.3 km from Khadki to Range Hills. Maha Metro had submitted its proposal to the defence ministry six months ago and was continuously following it up. With the clearances having arrived, the work on the metro corridor will now be speeded up, he said.",1

105,"Major intersections in Delhi death traps for pedestriansMajor intersections in Delhi are turning into death traps for pedestrians. With the rising number of vehicles and a lack of infrastructure for at-grade (at the surface level) crossings, the number of deaths involving pedestrians continues its steep rise every year.According to Delhi Police estimates, of the 1,604 people killed in road accidents last year, around 40% were pedestrians.(Picture for representation)Major intersections in Delhi are turning into death traps for pedestrians. With the rising number of vehicles and a lack of infrastructure for at-grade (at the surface level) crossings, the number of deaths involving pedestrians continues its steep rise every year. According to Delhi Police estimates, of the 1,604 people killed in road accidents last year, around 40% were pedestrians.The task of crossing at intersectionsCrossing busy intersections is an uphill task most pedestrians face on a regular basis. The art of racing to the other side of the road in a fraction of a second before the signal turns red for one section, and green for the other, is something that Delhiites have mastered over the years.An estimate by the Indian Road Congress (IRC) shows an average pedestrian in Delhi takes around seven to eight minutes to cross a busy intersection from end-to-end.This is because the signal timings often ignore those who mean to reach their final destination. After crossing each carriageway, pedestrians have to make a pit-stop for at least two minutes on dividers before they get to cross again. With proper infrastructure, this time can be reduced to three minutes, road safety experts said.They maintained that at intersections, signal timings should be adjusted with the average time taken by a pedestrian to cross the intersection from one end to the other kept in mind. Any breaks will only result in people jumping in front of vehicles off-turn and ending up risking their lives.Sahil Kumar, a bank employee working in Rohini’s Sector 18, said that during the peak morning traffic, he often has to wave at vehicles to slow down so that he can cross the road.“Most drivers end up hurling abuse at you for suddenly jumping on the road, waving your hand like a traffic police officer. But what option do we have? Waiting for these vehicles to stop will mean waiting for at least 15-20 minutes,” Kumar said. He added that the installation of pedestrian signals will give people like him some breather.“We constantly have drives to educate and fine drivers who stop their vehicles beyond the stop line, eating up on the zebra crossing for pedestrians. Safe roads are everyone’s right,” said joint commissioner of police (traffic) Alok Kumar. He also said that regular meetings are conducted with the road-owning agencies to come up with newer ways to make safe walking spaces for pedestrians.A study conducted by the IRC in 2016 proved that the presence of pedestrian signals on busy roads made people feel safer and decreased fatalities. It also showed pedestrians were willing to wait longer at such signals because of an assurance of safe passage when the lights go green.Lack of pedestrian infrastructureIn a 2013 study by Geetam Tiwari from Indian Institute of Technology (Delhi), the pattern of road accidents across major cities in the country over a span of five years was analysed, and it was confirmed that in the national capital, pedestrian deaths comprised at least 47% of all fatalities — the second highest in India after Mumbai.The reason for this alarming trend can be seen in the way the city’s roads are being designed. Despite studies proving pedestrian tendencies to cross the road at-grade, road-owning agencies are doing little to facilitate safe road crossing and walking facilities for them. The priority is on vehicles, which are the centre of the way the city’s roads are planned, experts said.Tiwari said India has been upgrading its highways with dividers, four- and six-lane roads and expressways since 2000. Yet, deaths due to road accidents continue to rise by 9%-10% each year.“The design completely ignores the requirements of walkers, bicyclists, two-wheeler users, even animal carts and other slow-moving traffic. We need to relook our car-centric road designs,” she said.As cities expand, so does vehicular traffic, but all emphasis is on ensuring better movement for cars, and so “cities are becoming hostile to pedestrians,” she said.Sample this. At the crossing outside the gates of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) on Sri Aurobindo Marg, despite the high pedestrian footfall of patients and their caretakers, there aren’t many avenues for people to cross over to the other side of the road safely, without having to wait endlessly.At the pedestrian signal at the gate, the lack of police presence sucks out any deterrence for speeding vehicles to give way to those looking to cross the road, and the apathy of road-owning agencies can be seen in the barely visible zebra crossing. Experts said that for government agencies, on most roads the only road-crossing facility is a gap between the grilles, through which a person or two can squeeze in.The solutionsTiwari said public spaces will improve if road designs move beyond the car-centric approach. “We need to change the way we design our roads and ensure better enforcement of rules,” she said. Experts stress the need to streamline the road geometry, bring the stop-line closer and make the intersection compact. “This will reduce the distance pedestrians have to walk and give them a sense of direction. We often find wide intersections that pedestrians are unable to cross in one go,” Amit Bhatt, director integrated transport, WRI India, maintained.Table-top crossings at slip roads can bring down the speed of vehicles and provide a smooth crossing facility to pedestrians. “Pedestrians prefer to cross at-grade. A majority of intersections are not well-designed. It is important that we factor in their requirements while redesigning our intersections. There is a need to provide refuge islands wherever possible,” Bhatt said.Also, government awareness programmes on road safety over the last 40 years have made little dent in improving road safety. The world over, research shows that individual behaviour cannot be changed without changing the physical environment in which traffic operates, and ensuring better enforcement of rules.The disadvantaged section of senior citizens and differently abled must be catered to. In most developed countries, provisions of pelican signals are made for the benefit of senior citizens, school children and differently abled, who can turn the pedestrian lights green to cross roads safely",0

They robbed him of his phone, smartwatch and wallet and forced him to withdraw money from ATM. (Shutterstock)Trying to help out an accident victim came at a high price for 24-year-old Rishabh Mandal who was duped, robbed of his valuables, and held captive for over two hours on Friday night.According to Mandal, he was on his way home in Patel Nagar, Delhi, when the incident occurred, near the Noida City Centre Metro station.“I got off an auto-rickshaw around 8pm at the service lane near the Metro station, when a man in his mid twenties approached me. He said his younger sister had met with an accident and was trapped in a car, and said he needed my help to pull her out of the car. I accompanied him to a street nearby to help him out,” Mandal, who is preparing for competitive exams, said.He said they were followed by another person, which was when he realised something was amiss.“The person who was following us asked what was going on. That’s when the tone of the man who asked for my help changed. I realised something was amiss and tried to leave. However, a third person blocked me from behind. One of them pulled out a gun and another held a knife to my throat. They took my phone, smartwatch and wallet. I didn’t have much cash on me so they asked me to withdraw money from any ATM. When I told them that I didn’t have money in the account, they asked me to arrange it and threatened me with dire consequences if I did not comply,” Mandal said.He said a couple of passersby were around. “But I was so scared that I could not approach them and anyone passing by would not have guessed what was going on. I called my elder brother for help. When he didn’t take the call, I called my younger brother and asked him to transfer money to my account,” he said, adding that the accused also suggested several excuses he could give his brother to encourage him to transfer the money.“I withdrew Rs 5,000, which he transferred to me and handed it over. They didn’t come into the ATM kiosk with me for fear of getting captured in the CCTV camera. When they realised that I was scared and was complying with their demands, they got greedier. They took my phone and asked my brother to send more money. They took nearly Rs 28,000 in multiple transactions,” he said.Mandal alleged that he tried to flee but the accused held him captive. “They were manhandling me the whole time and abusing me. They even threatened to kill me. Finally, around 10.10pm, when one of them was on his phone and the other two were talking, I decided to flee. They followed me, but I came upon a wedding party where I asked a few people for help. They gave me Rs 100 and dropped me at the Golf Course Metro station from where I came back home and filed an e-FIR,” said Mandal.Based on his complaint, a case of robbery (Section 392) under the Indian Penal Code was registered at the Sector 24 police station.“An investigation is ongoing in the case, and we will nab the accused soon,” Mithlesh Updhyay, station house officer, Sector 24 police station, said.",0

Gauri Mahadik (32), all set to join the Officers' Training Academy (OTA) at Chennai, said instead of just mourning her husband's death, she wanted to pay a befitting tribute to him by wearing his stars and uniform. Major Mahadik, who had joined the Army in 2012 and commissioned in the 7th Battalion of Bihar Regiment, died in the fire at his camp in Tawang near the Indo-China border in in December 2017. Post-completion of 49-week training at the OTA, Gauri Mahadik, a qualified company secretary and law graduate who recently topped the Service Selection Board (SSB) exam in the widow category, will be inducted into the Army as a Lieutenant by March 2020. ""After my husband's death, I was thinking what to do next...I thought I can not just sit and cry. So I decided that I should do something for him and make him proud. ""I decided to follow his footsteps and with a determination that I will wear his stars and uniform, started preparing for SSB examination,"" said Mahadik while talking to PTI from Virar, a distant suburb of Mumbai, over the phone.

He played well in Madrid,” said Allegri.“Expectations are higher this year, so there is a little disappointment and frustration, but it shouldn’t be, because there is still a game to be played.“Football is like life, it has its ups and downs.

115,"Ministry of Railways plans upgradation of 90 stations ahead of next general electionsModernised railway stations is something Indians have been long promised but it remains a pipe dream. Hopes were raised, yet again, in February when Finance Minister Arun Jaitley announced that 600 railway stations across the country had been picked for modernisation. All a part of the whopping Rs 1.48 trillion allocation to the railways - the highest ever for the sector - in the Modi government's last Budget before the next general elections.But then one remembered that a year earlier, then Railway Minister Suresh Prabhu had launched the first phase of what the ministry called the ""World's largest Station Redevelopment Program"", comprising 23 major railway stations. The idea was to redevelop the stations through the public-private-partnership (PPP) model, where the railways will provide approximately 140 acres of encroachment free land to the developers on a 45 year lease and hence the project would generally be cost neutral to the Railways. Moreover, according to a statement from the ministry at the time, the Rs 1 lakh crore program would benefit more than 100 cities and 16 million passengers per day across the country.Things did not quite pan out that way due to muted private investor interest. Undeterred, the Railways recently came out with a list of 68 stations earmarked for a facelift through its own resources before the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. The cost is pegged at Rs 5,000 crore. ""We can't wait for private investors anymore. We'll redevelop these stations on our own and could monetise them later through commercial exploitation,"" a top rail ministry official earlier told The Economic Times.The new list includes some of the busiest stations in the country like the Old Delhi railway station, Guwahati, Howrah, Patna, Allahabad, Udaipur, Haridwar, Pune, Bengaluru, Ambala, Chennai Egmore and Bhubaneshwar.The redevelopment plan has reportedly been assigned to the zonal railways with a one year deadline for completion. According to the daily, all the shortlisted railway stations will get state-of-the-art amenities, including elevators, swanky waiting room, a modern passenger announcement system, new platforms, shopping complex and airport-like entry and exit. The redevelopment will be closely monitored by the general managers of the respective zones and the divisional railway managers.""While doing this (redevelopment), efforts would be made to showcase local culture or history to reflect in the station facade. For instance Aurangabad station is to be developed on lines of Ajantha or Ellora, Agra station is to be developed on lines of Taj Mahal, Ujjain station is to be developed on lines of Mahakaleshwar temples,"" the ministry said in a statement in March.Apart from the 68 stations announced by the Railways, the redevelopment of the Habibganj railway station in Madhya Pradesh and the Gandhinagar railway station in Gujarat are already racing towards completion and seem on course to meet the December 2018 and January 2019 deadlines, respectively.These two stations have hogged the headlines of late given the impressive list of features they will pack. In case you missed the buzz, the Habibganj station will have a large waiting area comprising over 600 benches with neat and clean toilets and commercial hubs. Of the total Rs 450 crore allocated for the redevelopment of the Habibganj railway station, Rs 100 will be spent on improving the infrastructure, while the rest of the amount will be spent on building glass structures and facilities for food, entertainment, and the waiting area. The Indian Railway Stations Development Corporation Ltd. (IRSDC) is also working on other ideas like installing video game zones and virtual museums to make the station more passenger-friendly and commercially viable.The Gandhinagar railway station, scheduled to be inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi before the Vibrant Gujarat Summit in January 2019, is a special purpose vehicle (SPV) between the IRSDC and the Gujarat government. Around Rs 250 crore have been allocated for its redevelopment and the centre of attraction here will be a 300-room 5-star hotel built 22 metres above the ground, while the railway track will pass underneath it.

It is famous for its natural heritage that is the home for several wildlife animals, including 43 tigers, 15 panthers and around 1800 wild dogs.With an area of 625.40 sq km, the project includes Tadoba National, created in 1955 with an area of 116.55 sq km and Andhari wildlife sanctuary, created in 1986 with an area of 508.85 kms.It said that the tiger conservation in Tadoba national park was commendable for the last one and half decades. The tiger population has been increasing, though slowly, during the period. Population of the big cat in the area was 36 in 1994 census which has now increased by 43 in the last census.In view of its good track record, the Ministry of Environment and Forests also included the tiger reserve in its pilot project for mapping wildlife sanctuaries and parks by the Wildlife Institute of India, Dehradun. Rs 1.39-crore was sanctioned for the pilot project that would be completed in 36 months. Out of the five sites selected for this pilot project, three were tiger reserves - Tadoba-Andhari, Dudhwa and Corbett. The identified targets included generation of satellite data and securing the survey of India topographic maps.Talking to Hindustan Times, B Majumder, the PCCF (wildlife), and Maharashtra state said that by providing mobile and landline network, the park would certainly be able to benefit the tourists and forest personnel who are working there for wildlife conservation. “We are expecting more tourists after starting this facility,” he further claimed and informed that the BSNL was exploring to provide such facility in the locality.Meanwhile, the MTDC with the help of ministry and Railway and the ministry of Tourism is planning to start an exclusive narrow gauge vintage train from Nagpur to Nagbhir (near Tadoba) for tourists, an answer to the to Nagbhir (near Tadoba) for tourists, an answer to the Palace of Wheels in Rajasthan. The plan, which was postponed because of numerous reasons, would begin from January next.",1

119,"More MPs likely to quit parties in key Brexit weekThe prospect of more MPs quitting Conservative and Labour parties hung heavy over Westminster as Prime Minister Theresa May braced for a key week in parliament with a little over a month to go for the UK to leave the European Union on March 29.Labour deputy leader Tom Watson admitted on Sunday the party had to change to ensure more MPs do not take the extreme step of resigning, while May’s cabinet was under strain to maintain collective responsibility with three ministers openly, and others covertly, toeing new lines.Three cabinet ministers - business secretary Greg Clark, justice secretary David Gauke and works and pensions secretary Amber Rudd have already favoured extension to Article 50 to delay Brexit beyond March 29.May has been cautioned by senior advisors that she cannot sack ministers who vote this week to delay Brexit without causing a further rupture within her party, given the growing number of ministers and MPs reportedly in favour of delaying it.May used a party convention in Oxford to reiterate her position that has led to much hand-wringing inside and outside her party, as well as in Brussels: “Our focus to deliver Brexit must be absolute”.“We must not, and I will not, frustrate what was the largest democratic exercise in this country’s history. In the very final stages of this process, the worst thing we could do is lose our focus,” she said.As the newly-formed The Independent Group attracted funds from small and major donors worth “tens of thousands of pounds”, as former Labour MP Chuka Umunna put it, he called upon the British public to join the formation for a new kind of politics.He wrote in the Sunday Mirror: “This week we have come together in the national interest, to say ‘enough is enough’. We have each put everything on the line to give something new a try. Believe me, it wasn’t an easy decision for any of us”.“We don’t yet know the destination where the path we’ve taken will lead us. But what me and my Independent Group colleagues are absolutely clear about is that we cannot and must not recreate the old parties with their tribalism and incompetence”.",0
120,"More Staff For Railway Protection Force In Kashmir After Pulwama AttackThe Railway Protection Force (RPF) has increased the number of its personnel in Kashmir following the terror attack in Pulwama to ensure the safety of train passengers and to protect railway property, a senior official of the force said.A total of 40 CRPF personnel were killed and five injured on February 14 in a terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir when a Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammad suicide bomber rammed a vehicle carrying over 100 kg of explosives into their bus in Pulwama district.""We had a meeting with the Ministry of Home Affairs yesterday where the decision was taken to increase the presence of RPF in the region,"" said RPF DG Arun Kumar.""The chairman railway board also had a detailed security briefing with all zonal and divisional RPF officers on the security of railways. It was decided that a company of RPF will be sent to Kashmir for additional security,"" he said.While four companies of the RPF are stationed in Kashmir, one more, with 125 personnel, will be airlifted from Jammu to the area, he added.",1
121,"MoS Railways dubs Railway Protection Force as 'toothless', demands more power for it Dubbing the RPF as a ""toothless"" organisation, Minister of State for Railways Manoj Sinha on Wednesday strongly pitched for more powers for it even as his senior ministerial colleague Piyush Goyal played down his concerns, asserting that regardless of a law they should move on with their work Goyal also said an amendment to the existing Railways Act was only a ""technicality"", and urged the Railway Protection Force (RPF) and the Government Railway Police (GRP) to work together to secure railways and passengers. Speaking at a conference on security of railways, both Sinha and RPF Director General Arun Kumar pushed for handing over the registration, enquiry and detection of passenger-related crimes on board running trains to the force. Currently, even if a crime is detected by the RPF, the case has to be handed over to the GRP for further enquiry. RPF is a toothless organisation. It is involved in security, but has no powers. Despite ability and efforts, the RPF has not got the powers it deserves. However, it is blamed for everything that happens on railway premises. But the reality is that other than taking care (of railway property), RPF has no real powers. An amendment in the law, I personally feel, is the need of the hour,"" Sinha said However, Goyal asserted that ""whether the law is changed or not, whether the GRP does it or the RPF, these are all technicalities. We have to decide that we need to work together to secure passengers. Then law will not come in the way."" The RPF DG also highlighted how his force can leverage its inherent advantage of having an all India jurisdiction to prevent and detect crime in moving trains. Since the jurisdiction of an RPF posts cuts across jurisdiction of many police stations, it has an advantage of identifying place of occurrence, quick registration of the case and subsequent detection, Kumar added. ""Therefore, we may consider empowering RPF to register, investigate and detect passenger luggage thefts so that the state police can concentrate on checking serious crimes like robbery, dacoity, rape, murder and focus its efforts in maintenance of law and order in railway premises. ""A draft bill for amendment in Railways Act to empower RPF to register, enquire and prosecute cases of passenger luggage theft and crime against women has been approved to be sent to the cabinet for further legislative action,"" he said.

122,"MoU Signed For Development Of Railway Infrastructure In TelanganaIn the august presence of Chairman, Railway Board Shri A.K. Mital an Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between Ministry of Railways and State Government of Telangana for “Formation of Joint Venture Companies for Development of Railway Infrastructure in the State of Telangana” has been signed.On the event of Signing Ceremony, Chairman Railway Board Shri A. K. Mital, Member Engineering Shri V. K. Gupta, Member Staff Shri Pradip Kumar, Secretary Railway Board Shri R. K. Verma and other Board Members and Senior Officials were present. On behalf of the Railway Ministry Shri Ved Prakash Dudeja, Executive Director/Works signed the MoU whereas on behalf of Government of Telangana, Shri Sunil Sharma, Principal Secretary, Department of Transport, Roads & Buildings, Govt. of Telangana signed the MoU. Dr. Shashank Goel, Resident Commissioner, Govt. of Telangana was present among others. The MoU was signed in the backdrop of Railway Minister’s Budget announcement regarding setting up of Joint Ventures with States for focused project development, resource mobilization, land acquisition, project implementation and monitoring of critical rail projects.Speaking on the occasion, Chairman Railway Board stated that Railways has a big shelf of projects valuing about 3.5 lakh crore. Last year, Railways had sanctioned additional lines of nine thousand kilometres. There has always been lot of expectations from various States for new railway lines/lands. Thus, to meet the demands of the States, a Cabinet note was got approved for formation of JV Companies. He stated that 17 States have already consented for formation of JV Companies in their respective States and 5 States have already signed MoUs with Railway Ministry in this regard which are Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, Odisha. He stated that today’s MoU will help in putting the execution of railways projects on fast track.  He stated that this will also help to take into account the priorities of the States because these projects will be finalized in consultation with the States as there would be offices from State Governments as well as Railways in the new Company which will be formed.  He stated that this is very welcome step which takes the partnership of State and Centre together to take railway projects on very fast pace. Salient Features of the MoU:-  In view of the growing demands for railway lines in various states and huge requirement of funds to execute them, Minister for Railways announced in his budget speech regarding setting up of Joint Ventures with states for focused project development, resource mobilization, land acquisition, project implementation and monitoring of critical rail projects. 17 State Governments consented for formation of Joint Venture Companies in collaboration with the Ministry of Railways for development of rail infrastructure in their respective States. Draft MoU were sent to these State Governments and discussions were also held with them to clarify various provisions of the MoU.MoUs have already been signed by the Ministry of Railways with the State Governments of Odisha, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Kerala and Chhattisgarh.Today, MoUs are being signed with the State Governments of Telangana. This signing of MOU is going to be a stepping stone for formation of JV companies.The MoU envisages formation of a Joint Venture companies having 51% stakes of the respective State Government and 49% stakes of Ministry of Railways. Thus, the JV companies shall be fully owned by the Government. The companies will primarily identify projects and possible financing avenues in addition to Govt of India and the State Governments. After finances for a project are tied up, project specific SPVs or special purpose vehicles shall be formed. These SPVs can have other stake holders from Industries, Central PSUs, and State PSUs etc. However, the JV companies shall be mandatory stake holders with minimum 26% shares in the SPVs.The ministry of Railways will sign a concession agreement of 30 years with the project SPV for safe and sound operation, revenue sharing and providing technical & marketing logistics to the SPV. The revenue sharing shall be based on already established formula being used for inter zonal apportionment of revenue.The most important aspect of this MoU is that the ownership of the land shall vest with the SPVs which are a departure from previous practice. This will give financial leverage to the company to exploit commercial potential of the land. This is likely to result in making project viable which are otherwise not viable.At the end of concession period, the railways will have option to take over the assets at a nominal price. This is largely in line with average codal life of the assets as most of the assets will need large scale replacement after 30 years.Indian Railways has been playing a major role in national integration by connecting the remotest places and bringing people closer to each other. Railways receive a large number of demands for network expansion as a railway line acts as an engine of growth for the area it serves.However, Railways have a large shelf of ongoing New Line, Gauge Conversion and Doubling projects needing about Rs 3.5 lakh crores to complete. We have been trying to meet the aspirations of public within limited availability of funds.To expedite the projects, Railways have been trying to mobilize resources through other than Gross Budgetary Support. However, on the initiative of Minister for Railways Sh. Suresh Prabhu, Indian Railways have tied up funds for critical capacity enhancement project of doubling, third line, electrification etc. A MoU was signed with LIC of India and we have already taken first tranche of Rs 2000 Cr for these projects. This tied up loan will ensure dedicated and assured funding for such critical projects.Indian Railways have targeted to commission 2000 Km New Lines, 4000 Km Gauge Conversion and 11000 Km Doubling/Tripling/ Quadrupling projects over 5 years i.e. from 2015-16 to 2019-20. In 2015-16, we had kept quite ambitious target of commissioning 2500 Km Broad Gauge track. It is a matter of great satisfaction that we are poised to not only achieve these targets but to surpass them. We have already commissioned about 1300 Km Broad Gauge track till December, 2015 against 800 Km track commissioned in the corresponding period of the previous year (Due to monsoons, major commissioning takes place in the last quarter of the financial year).Formation of Joint Venture Companies with the State Governments will go a long way in faster commissioning of critical rail infrastructure projects as it will not only help in mobilization of funds but also in facilitating various clearances and land acquisition.",1

The handset instead uses light sensors to scan the veins in a user’s hand or to recognise their face.The phone’s front-facing camera, which uses a sensor chip developed by Germany’s Infineon Technologies , can scan in three dimensions - making it more secure than existing biometric methods of unlocking phones such as fingerprints.LG product evangelist David Montanya told a launch event it would be harder to ‘spoof’ than the FaceID feature used in Apple’s iPhone X because the vein structure in a user’s hand has less than one chance in a billion of being the same as anyone else’s.Users can also activate features with gestures - for example to play or pause a song or video, or adjust the volume, by twisting their fingers, emulating the character played by Tom Cruise in science-fiction detective thriller Minority Report.LG did not set release dates or announce prices for the new phones, but said the 5G model should hit stores in the first half of the year.",0
124,"Mumbai rail roko | Highlights: Protest called off, but agitators warn of another stir; train services resumeCommuters in Mumbai travelling on the Central Railway (CR)?struggled on Tuesday, after railway apprentices decided to protest against the railway recruitment system by resorting to rail roko between Matunga and Dadar railway stations on the main line during the morning rush hours.The railways select and appoint apprentices for various technical jobs, to be done in their various workshops across India. Earlier, these apprentices were absorbed into the railways as they got preference during recruitments. However, in 2016, the railway ministry decided to stop this and offer them just a 20% quota. Since then, ,many apprentices have not been able to get railway jobs and have been staging protests.Protesters on Tuesday blocked all the CR?lines, so both the slow and fast local train services ahead of Matunga have been shut completely, forcing commuters to walk on tracks. “Due to some agitation between Matunga and Dadar, rail traffic has been affected between Matunga and CSMT,” said Sunil Udasi, chief public relations officer, CR.The agitation started after 7am, and went on for around three-and-a-half hours.Here are the highlights:11.51am: Protesters head to Bandra (east), likely to meet MNS?chief Raj Thackeray at MIG Club.11.30am: Tracks cleared and trains running.

125,"Mumbai railway train commute is as noisy as an alarm clock ringing constantlyHear this. Your daily train commute on the Mumbai suburban railway is as noisy as an alarm clock ringing constantly, according to a study. While the study revealed that the Western Railway is the noisiest at 119.1 dB — as loud as a steel factory, the Central Railway is quieter, but only marginally, at 91.6dB.Non-governmental organisation (NGO) Awaaz Foundation measured noise using decibel meters from an old train between Bandra station and Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus (CST) on the harbour line, a new train between CST and Thane station and both old and new trains between Churchgate and Virar stations on the western line. While Virar station was the noisiest on the western line, Byculla station and Mahim junction were the noisiest on the harbour and central lines respectively.“Railway noise levels have been a huge source of stress, which has not been recognised up till now. After our readings were made public, complaints have been pouring in about how much it affects their daily life. This is just the beginning and there is a lot more to be done to reduce this source of noise pollution,” said Sumaira Abdulali, convener, Awaaz Foundation. “All types of travel are an integral part of people’s lives. The Centre needs to restrict noise levels on the suburban railways, like it has been done by the Airport Authority of India, which made the Mumbai airport a silent one.”Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) officials said that the readings were a cause for concern and pose a serious threat to people’s lives as they are exposed to such levels daily. “We will be raising the issue with the Union environment ministry and the railway ministry as noise readings close to 120dB is dangerous for even healthy people if they are exposed to it daily,” said D Saha, additional director, CPCB.",1
126,"Mumbai rain: Late trains, traffic snarls, water, scary wall collapse, et al. Mumbai came to a standstill on Monday -- just a few days after the onset of monsoon -- as overnight rains led to the usual chaos of delayed trains, water-logged roads, horrific traffic snarls, and a rather scary wall collapse in a central neighbourhood of the city. Four people have died in the last 24 hours in the city and its suburbs. A 15-year-old died after falling into an open pit in Malad. Another 13-year-old was killed in a wall collapse in thane. Two died yesterday when a tree collapsed on them near Azad Maidan in South Mumbai. A large part of the boundary wall of a plush apartment complex in Wadala collapsed and subsided in the morning, burying nearly a dozen cars. The damaged cars, mostly belonging to residents of the complex -- Lloyds  Estate -- were stuck in debris.Local trains, the city's life line, were running behind schedule as usual, at the hint of the first heavy rains this season. Water-logging was reported from low-lying areas and office-goers and vehicles found it difficult to navigate roads in large parts of the city.  Meanwhile, Mumbai's civic body officials placed pumps on stand-by in neighbourhoods that are prone to water-logging.  The Indian Meteorological Department has said that heavy to very heavy rains are expected to continue.Two people died and five were injured on Sunday after a tree fell on them near Metro Cinema at MG Road in South Mumbai's Marine Lines area, according to news agency ANI.A 13-year-old boy was killed and his parents were injured when an adjacent wall collapsed on their house at Wadol village in Ambernath taluka of Thane around 2:15 am today, the district civic body's regional disaster management cell chief Santosh Kadam told news agency PTI. In another incident, a 65-feet compound wall of a housing complex in Thane city collapsed this morning, crushing two cars and another vehicle, he said.  On Sunday, Mumbai recorded the highest amount of rainfall at 110.80 mm between 8:30 am and 4:30 pm, a Met department official said.",1
127,"Mumbai stampede: Tragedy is fallout of misplaced prioritiesIt is a sad irony. The stampede took place at Elphinstone Road station on the day railway minister Piyush Goyal was to visit Mumbai and get a first-hand experience of the struggle millions of daily commuters face as they commute between work place and home in overcrowded trains. In fact, the railway officials were also considering an event to rename Elphinstone Road station during Goyal’s visit to Mumbai on Friday, but it was somehow put on hold.For the past few years, commuters’ associations and activists have been raising the issue of overcrowded foot overbridges and narrow staircases at Parel and Elphinstone Road stations and warning the authorities that there could be a stampede-like situation here. The Hindustan Times published several reports on the subject. A plan for makeover of the two stations on two different suburban lines (central and western) joined by a narrow foot overbridge was prepared a few years ago. However, typically it was not given priority. On the other hand, a political demand to rename Elphinstone Road station as Prabhadevi was taken up on urgent basis and a notification was issued by the railway ministry in no time.Anybody who takes a glance at the two stations during morning and evening peak hours can tell there is an urgent need to rebuild their basic infrastructure. In fact, not just Parel and Elphinstone Road, but some other stations in central Mumbai have been witnessing similar problems. Following the redevelopment of mill land, in which defunct textile mills gave way to skyscrapers housing commercial offices, central Mumbai’s Parel-Worli belt became a commercial hub. Footfall at these stations saw a massive increase. The railway officials, however, are slow to react to the development and the outcome is there to see.Even the Maharashtra government and Mumbai civic body who gave permission for vertical development of central Mumbai should share the blame for the incident. Both the state and city governments were well aware of the development in the area, but did little to upgrade the infrastructure there.The incident also raises questions over the way the suburban railway network is governed by the railway ministry.The railway ministry is taking up projects such as air-conditioned trains, elevated railway corridors and above all, the Rs1,00,000-crore Mumbai-Ahmedabad bullet train. There could be a case for planning for the future, but what about the need to improve and upgrade basic infrastructure at railway stations? Shouldn’t that be a priority?Experts and commuters’ associations have been demanding there should be a separate cadre to handle the suburban train networks at mega cities like Mumbai, as the top railway officers often fail to understand how the Mumbai suburban section, which is used daily by over 7 million commuters, needs to be run. Maybe, it’s time to consider this demand as well.",1

After the approval, we will start identification of land. Banks will also be approached for loan,” said an MRVC official.With the expansion of the suburban railway network, the railway authorities have clubbed major projects under the umbrella of MUTP-3A. Procurement of 210 AC local trains, elevated corridor between CSMT- Panvel, too, are included in it. The project will increase the operational capacity of the western railway, further segregating suburban and long distance traffic up to Virar. It will also provide east-west connectivity to the extended suburbs of Mumbai.",1

Banks will also be approached for loan,” said an MRVC official.With the expansion of the suburban railway network, the railway authorities have clubbed major projects under the umbrella of MUTP-3A. Procurement of 210 AC local trains, elevated corridor between CSMT- Panvel, too, are included in it. The project will increase the operational capacity of the western railway, further segregating suburban and long distance traffic up to Virar. It will also provide east-west connectivity to the extended suburbs of Mumbai.",1

131,"Mumbai: Railways to evict illegal hawkers from entry and exit points of stations, FOBs In a bid to prevent incidents like the Elphinstone station stampede that claimed 23 lives, the railway administration has undertaken a drive to evict illegal hawkers from the entry and exit points of the station as well as from the foot overbridges to ease commuter movement.Twenty-three persons were killed in the stampede on a foot overbridge (FOB) linking two railways stations in Mumbai on Friday during the deadly rush hour. ""Though action against hawkers is undertaken on a regular basis, from October 1, this drive has been intensified with a combined operation launched by the RPF and GRP, and moreover they will also be patrolling the FoBs,"" said chief spokesperson of the Western Railway Ravinder Bhakar.However, passengers and railway representatives want permanent eviction of hawkers and have warned the railway officials that they would report to the Railways Minister if the hawkers return to do business at these spots.Bhakar said Western Railway administration is soon going to demarcate the railway area to stop this menace forever.He said, ""Most of the complaints against hawkers we receive, fall under the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) area where we do not have our administrative control. So we are blamed unnecessarily. Therefore, we have decided to demarcate our periphery and we will keep full vigil within our jurisdiction.""The Central Railway too has launched a drive against illegal hawkers at several stations including Ghatkopar, Kurla, Byculla, Mulund.Eviction of hawkers paved way for smooth movement of commuters near railway stations and on foot overbridges.Senior PRO of Central Railway A K Jain said, ""Though our security forces, keep driving away unauthorised hawkers, they have been now been asked to deal strictly with them.""Rajiv Singal, who has been a member of Railway Users Consultative Committees in Central Railway and Western Railway, however, dubs this exercise of evicting hawkers as merely an ""eyewash"".Singal said, ""This is simply dressing up and no permanent cure. It is showoff because audit team is doing their job and media pressure is working. I can bet you, hawkers will be back again.""""Until and unless, disciplinary action is not taken against the senior RPF officials in whose jurisdiction hawkers operate, nothing is going to change,"" Singal said.T N Dubey, former member of Divisional Railway Users Consultative Committees in Western Railway, said, ""If hawkers come back, we will write to the Railways Minister and draw his attention to the issue.""

135,"Odisha to implement PM-KISAN; farmers to benefit from central and state schemesChief minister Naveen Patnaik’s government had earlier been noncommittal on the PM’s farm intervention scheme as well.By MEERA MOHANTYBHUBANESHWAR: The Odisha government has agreed to implement the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN), deciding to share the first list of beneficiaries under its own farm-intervention programme for the Centre’s cash-transfer scheme. Chief minister Naveen Patnaik’s government, which had refused to implement the Ayushman Bharat central health insurance scheme, had earlier been noncommittal on the PM’s farm intervention scheme as well. The Centre is expected to formally launch the PM-KISAN scheme, announced in the interim budget 2019-20, at a farmers’ conclave in Gorakhpur in Uttar Pradesh on February 24. The onus on identifying beneficiaries for it has been placed with the states. Preoccupied with a state-wide rollout of its own Krushak Assistance for Livelihood and Income Augmentation (KALIA) scheme — it covers sharecroppers and landless agriculture labour as well — the state government had not decided who would qualify for the central scheme. On Thursday, the state announced it would share the list of 12.45 lakh small and marginal farmers who had received the first instalment of Rs 5,000 under the KALIA scheme. These farmers, holding up to 2 hectares of land, in the state now stand to gain an additional Rs 6,000 in three instalments through the year under the PM-KISAN scheme. Addressing a gathering of farmers at Sohela in Bargarh district, Patnaik on Thursday launched the Phase-II of KALIA. The scheme has been praised by economists for not being a loan waiver and including sharecroppers and landless farmers. Those with landholding get an assistance of Rs 25,000 (over five cropping seasons) while sharecroppers and the landless farmers get Rs 12,500 in three instalments. Patnaik’s said: “It is very sad that the Centre’s scheme does not have anything for these neglected and deprived sections (sharecroppers and landless farmers). I have taken up the issue with the Prime Minister and demanded steps for supporting the landless farmers, sharecroppers and agricultural workers and protecting their interests.” He also wanted the assistance to be enhanced from Rs 6,000 to Rs 10,000. The KALIA juggernaut — with posters, billboards, and conventions sweeping the countryside — has practically the entire state machinery occupied even as Patnaik’s Biju Janata Dal aims for a fifth-term in the government. The government’s latest announcement is KALIA scholarships. The state government, which claims to have already paid 16 lakh farmers, said on Thursday it distributed money to another 14 lakh small and marginal farmers.",0
136,"Opinion |?BJP needs another Modi waveWhat do the most recent state elections tell us about the likely fortunes of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the 2019 national election?The BJP lost the elections in all three of the Hindi belt states that went to the polls in November and December, including two states (Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh) it had controlled for 15 years. This continued a string of weaker-than-expected electoral performances (e.g., Bihar, Gujarat) in states where the BJP had a dominant performance in the 2014 national election.BJP partisans remind us that national elections are very different from state elections and that one should not extrapolate from these results — Modi’s charisma and popularity will loom large in 2019, they argue. Meanwhile, the Opposition sees these results as unmistakeable evidence that the BJP will be greatly weakened in 2019.Political punditry aside, what do state elections really tell us about national elections?It should be clear that state-level voter preferences play a major role even in national elections. Several state-level political parties such as the Trinamool Congress (TMC), the Biju Janata Dal (BJD) or the Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) are likely to win many seats in the Lok Sabha, even though they do not have clearly articulated national agendas. This is a natural consequence of the fact that a party’s capacity to deliver benefits and infrastructure such as roads and schools locally and the strength of the local party organisation are among the most significant determinants of a popularity (even in national elections) — and strong regional parties often perform well on these criteria. At the same time, charismatic leaders such as Indira Gandhi or Narendra Modi, and specific issues or policies like the Ram Janmabhoomi movement or the popularity of the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (NREGS) have helped the BJP or the Congress disproportionately in national elections.In some ways, a party’s performance in Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan is likely to be more predictive of the outcome even in national elections; they also do not have the coalition dynamics of Karnataka or Uttar Pradesh and are largely straight BJP/Congress contests. The BJP won state contests in Chhattisgarh, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh in 2007 and 2008, and also won these states in the 2009 national election, even in the face of a commanding performance by Congress nationally. The BJP won all four states in 2012 and 2013, and swept them in the 2014 national election. Of the 91 parliamentary constituencies (PCs) in these four states, the BJP won an eye-popping 88 seats, a strike rate of 97%. About 31% of all seats the BJP won in 2014 came from just these four states.Data from the Election Commission of India (ECI) allows the analysis of national election results down to state assembly constituency (AC) level.Chart 1 displays the AC-level vote share for the BJP in 2012 and 2013 state elections with the AC-level vote share for the BJP in the 2014 national election. There is clearly strong statistical relationship — state electoral results predict national results. For every 10% increase in AC-level vote share for the BJP in a state election, there is a roughly 5.7% increase in vote share in the 2014 national election. To be sure, the 2014 result was more than a repeat of past state results. It was a wave election, and Narendra Modi had a major effect. In these four states, the BJP had an average vote share of 45% in state elections but an average of 55% in the 2014 national election.This implies a Modi effect — the extra bump to BJP’s vote share in going from state to national elections — of about 10%. This 10% was not distributed uniformly, some areas saw much larger increases than 10% and some areas saw much less.Cut to the present situation. In 2017 and 2018, the average vote share of the BJP in state elections in these four states dropped to 41%. Given the poorer performance in these four states (it retained Gujarat and lost the other three), and the uneven distribution of the Modi effect, how will the BJP perform in 2019?Chart 2 displays the predicted number of seats in these four states in the 2019 national election using a statistical model accounting for the relationship between state and national results and the scale of the Modi effect (and its uneven distribution) — all based on how the 2012 and 2013 state election data predict the 2014 results.If there is a Modi effect at 2014 Modi wave levels, then the BJP can be expected to win about 83 seats in 2019, only five less than in 2014. But if the Modi effect drops to about 5% (that’s still a fairly large effect), then the BJP will only win about 65 out of the 91 seats in these four states.If there is no Modi effect, then the party will win just 37 seats.When combined with a stronger opposition coalition in Uttar Pradesh, the BJP will have a tough time returning to power in such a scenario.The BJP will need to repeat its commanding performance in these four states if it is to win again. No one can really say what will be the electoral impact of the BJP’s announcement of reservations for economically backward classes or the Pulwama attack.But this analysis underscores one simple point. The BJP will have to manufacture another Modi wave if it is to return to power in 2019.",0

See all the photos of JLo and Kareena’s matching looks before you say no.Kareena Kapoor might not have attended the 2019 Oscars. However, photos of the Bollywood actor’s stunning metallic dress from a recent awards function have everyone comparing her sparkly dress to one worn by actor-singer Jennifer Lopez at the 91st Academy Awards in Los Angeles on Monday. JLo might not have been nominated for an Oscar, but she made sure to leave quite the impression on the red carpet, dressed in head-to-toe sparkle, courtesy of fashion designer Tom Ford. For the star-studded occasion, JLo, who also presented an Oscar, teamed her shimmering metallic long-sleeved gown with sleek wavy hair and stunning diamond jewellery. Interestingly, Jennifer Lopez’s Oscars dress looks a lot like Kareena Kapoor’s equally mirrored and sparkling dress by Dubai-based fashion designer, Atelier Zuhra. Take a look JLo and Kareena’s silver dresses that screamed maximalist glamour:While these Jennifer Lopez and Kareena Kapoor dresses bear obvious resemblance to one another — both have mock necks, which elongate their silhouettes — JLo’s shiny floor-length look is (as expected) more red carpet than Kareena’s sleeveless ankle-length dress. JLo’s figure-hugging Tom Ford gown was covered in mosaic mirrored tiles and glistened under the bright lights on the red carpet of Hollywood’s biggest night. Jennifer Lopez added even more shine to her glam by wearing a chunky diamond ring and matching earrings.Kareena Kapoor’s fitted dress, which she wore to the Social Media Summit and Awards 2018 in November, was also decorated with mosaic crystal embellishments, but offered a more fun, party vibe. It featured Atelier Zuhra’s signature shattered mosaic crystal mirrors — inspired by Barcelona’s Gaudí architecture. Another similarity between Kareena and Jennifer’s looks? Their make-up. Both JLo and Kareena wore a dramatic smoky eye to complement their metallic dresses. While, the jury is still out on whether Jennifer Lopez’ Tom Ford gown was inspired by Kareena Kapoor’s Atelier Zuhra design, our guess is not — considering both JLo and Tom Ford don’t need much inspiration to churn out fashion gold (or silver).",0
138,"Pakistan’s house of cards: How its purported aces have been trumpedSome of Pakistan’s purported aces have been trumped by New Delhi over the years, others have been neutralised, and some have outlived their utility. Here are nine cards Pakistan has played against India.By Chidanand RajghattaPakistan has used various “trump” cards over the decades to stalk and stall India’s growth fuelled by being an open, democratic and plural society despite some recent challenges. Some of Pakistan’s purported aces have been trumped by New Delhi over the years, others have been neutralised, and some have outlived their utility. Here are nine cards Pakistan has played against India. The American Card: Used from the time Pakistan was formed when its leaders quickly allied with Washington even as India stumbled into the Soviet orbit. The end of the Cold War, the collapse of the Soviet Union, India’s economic reforms and subsequent growth, the Kargil war, and 9/11 (which had Pakistan’s fingerprints on it) resulted in Pakistan losing this hand. The Afghan Card: Fearful of India’s size and growing heft, Pakistan has long sought “strategic depth” in Afghanistan by installing a friendly, puppet regime in Kabul, a strategy that resulted in the coming to power of Taliban in 1996 (and eventually led to 9/11). But Pakistani overreach built on a Sunni-Wahhabi construct has ruined this card. Except in Taliban pockets, Pakistan is now despised by most Afghans who see it as a malign force. The Kashmir Card: A card the Pakistan military and its elites have played since 1947 to corner resources. Most poor Pakistanis care squat about Kashmir, which is “cash mere” for the Pakistani military as it dips its hand in the till. The Pakistani establishment continues to lie to its own people about UN Resolution (47) on Kashmir (which actually enjoins that Pakistan should first withdraw from the areas it has occupied before other steps). With the passage of time, changes in demographics etc, the resolution, which was non-binding in the first place, is now infructuous. But Pakistan won’t accept it because peace would mean having to whittle down its military budget. The Saudi Card: In this petro dollars-for-nuclear cover deal, the House of Saud has long backed and bankrolled Pakistan, acquiring an outsized influence on its domestic politics to the extent that it is a go-to place for Pakistanis in retirement or exile. But Saudis themselves have embarked on a nuclear quest, and India’s growing influence (it has greater number of workers and white collar workers) means Pakistan’s influence is being reduced down despite Ummah solidarity. As Crown Prince Salman suggested to his hosts last week, when living next to the world’s #3 and #2 economies Pakistan would benefit from peace. The Muslim Ummah Card: Over the years, Pakistan has presented itself as a champion of the Islamic world and has singularly prevented India from acquiring even an observer status in the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), whose associates go beyond the 50-Muslim majority countries in the world (Russia and Thailand for instance have observer status). India, which has the world’s second largest Muslim population after Indonesia, has gradually increased its influence in the the Islamic world (particularly in the Gulf), and a breakthrough is inevitable. But its task will be made difficult if the Hindutva hotheads at home run amuck. The Russia Card: As India has gravitated towards the United States and Pakistan has lost traction in Washington, Islamabad has tried to woo countries such as Russia, Turkey and even Iran in the hope of strengthening its China card. But it is a weak hand. Pakistan is so caught up in domestic radicalisation and internecine bloodletting that few countries have any confidence in its long-term prospects. And despite India’s on-again, off-again ties with these countries, New Delhi interest and influence on account of its economic heft. The China Card (and for China, Pakistan Card): China finds it useful to constrain India using Pakistan. The day India begins to use demographic, economic and cultural clout, the usefulness of this card could diminish. Just think of all the Chinese phones we buy, the general size of the Indian market. China will also not want to import Pakistan’s radicalisation into its sensitive Xinjiang province. The Terrorism Card: Pakistan’s most potent card, an extension of its “death by thousand cut” policy following its defeat in the 1971 war. India’s weaknesses, including in its security doctrine, and global indifference, had enabled Pakistan to export terror (its principal export) and get away, literally, with murder. New Delhi has failed to sensitise world capitals of Pakistani fingerprints on not just terror attacks in India but in many other places across the world. The Nuclear Card: Pakistan’s ultimate trump card that gives cover to its terrorism, one that India failed to take care of between 1971 and 1984 by which time it was too late. The Nuclear Card: Pakistan’s ultimate trump card that gives cover to its terrorism, one that India failed to take care of between 1971 and 1984 by which time it was too late. Remarkably, Pakistan does not have a Pakistan card. The world’s sixth most populous nation has the sixth largest army (and is a nuclear power to boot), but its economy is ranked 24th in size. Maharashtra has a larger economy, and Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Gujarat will each overtake it soon. Nearly Nearly ten times the size of Pakistan’s economy, India is adding one Pakistan to its GDP each year, and will have an economy roughly 40 times larger by 2050. This growing imbalance is actually what makes the Pakistani military reckless in its support of terrorism. New Delhi has only one card – the India card. Playing a cool, calculated, and cohesive hand, while quietly attriting Pakistan, economically and through covert payback, without the hysteria, histrionics and grandstanding currently on display, will yield better results. The Pakistani house of cards will inevitably collapse.",0
139,"Panel wants railway ministry to create body to regulate faresA parliamentary committee wants the railway ministry to create the body it has long promised to, that will, among other things, regulate fares.In its latest report, the Railway Convention Committee of Parliament maintained that since the proposed authority is yet to take a final shape, “consideration of suitable subsidy sharing mechanism is yet to begin.”Parties in power rarely increase passenger fares, irrespective of the carrier’s financial health , given the political ramifications of such a move. The idea to set up an independent body to suggest fare hikes and other reforms was mooted during the United Progressive Alliance’s (UPA) tenure.In April 2017, the NDA government first approved the setting up of the Rail Development Authority (RDA), to make “Pricing of services commensurate with costs, suggest measures for enhancement of Non Fare Revenue, protection of consumer interests, by ensuring quality of service and cost optimization, promoting competition, efficiency and economy”, among other things.The RDA didn’t start functioning and railway ministry officials recently suggested that the creation of the body could take even more time, with parliamentary elections around the corner.The House panel, led by BJD’s Bhartruhari Mahtab, noted that “in view of the fact that the principals of sharing subsidies/ social costs involve reimbursement of such costs to the railways by finance ministry and other departments, the committee stress that the process of establishment of the proposed Railway Regulatory Authority be expedited.”The Parliamentary panel supported the idea of the merger of the rail budget with the general budget—a practice started since 2017—but expressed concern that a decision to demarcate between commercial and social activities of the Indian rail and the reimbursement of the social service obligation has not been done so far.",1
140,"Pepper traders cite Sri Lankan minister statement on illegal imports to IndiaIn a letter to the commerce minister, pepper consortium has raised concerns over spurt in illegal imports of Vietnam pepper.ET Bureau|Feb 12, 2019, 07.57 PM ISTKOCHI: The pepper traders have appealed to the commerce ministry to take steps to raise vigil to prevent the import of pepper from Vietnam through Sri Lanka with origin of certificate from the latter, citing the recent statement by a Sri Lankan minister in media. Kishore Shamji, the coordinator of the Kerala chapter of Indian Pepper and Spice Traders, Growers , Planters Consortium said in a letter to commerce minister Suresh Prabhu that Sri Lankan minister has said that he hasn’t been able to prevent the export of 156 containers of Vietnam pepper to India with certificate of origin from Sri Lanka as it is a racket similar to narcotics trafficking. ``We have been cautioning the Indian government since last week of January that 180 containers of about 1800 to 2000 tonnes of such pepper have left Sri Lankan coast,’’ he said.. This is over and above the pepper smuggled to India from Myanmar, Bangladesh and Nepal, he added The supply of Vietnam pepper is happening by evading duty to the tune of 43% as the duty for import from Vietnam is 51% against 8% for Sri Lanka under India Sri lanka Free Trade Agreement, circumventing the minimum import price of Rs 500 per kg fixed by India for pepper imports. Shamji said the Indian importer pays the minimum import price of Rs 500 ($ 7100 per tonne), for which duty comes to Rs 40 at 8%. Since the Sri Lankan pepper price is $ 3000 per tonne, the balance $4100 is in many cases not remitted. Those who are paying $ 7100 in full gets back the excess money through hawala in cash in Indian rupees. ` In both cases it is a violation of FEMA rules,’’ he alleged. He said such pepper are sold in Indian markets below the domestic price of Rs 350 per kg. Shamji urged the authorities to enforce steps to test for a minimum of 6% piperine content in such imports if it is for extraction purpose. The Vietnam pepper has only 4 to 5 % of piperine, he said.",0
141,"PM-KISAN to provide multiple benefits to farmers: CEAThe average income of farmers in 2015-16 was about Rs 30,000 and, hence, Rs 6,000 would be 20 per cent.PTI|Feb 17, 2019, 12.12 PM ISTNEW DELHI: Farm income support scheme PM-KISAN will provide multiple benefits to farmers, including improving their credit worthiness, said Chief Economic Adviser K V Subramanian. The Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi Yojana (PM-KISAN) was announced in the Interim Budget 2019-20, under which Rs 6,000 will be given in three instalments to 12 crore small and marginal farmers holding cultivable land up to 2 hectare. Producer support in India is very low compared to the other countries and the scheme will help in supplementing that, he told PTI. ""Across countries, producer support for farmers are quite high. The recent OECD study which talks about producers support in India is quite low. ""This section is the one which will be feeding 125 crore mouths and you have a population which is growing at less than 1 per cent and food production is growing at greater than 3 per cent,"" he said. Therefore, Subramanian said, there will be surpluses leading to fall in prices impacting income of farmers. Moreover, he said, the reason farming is supported in a lot of countries is that the risk-return trade-off is bad in the sector. ""Therefore, this constituent required support. There is definitely a case for supporting in a way that does not create distortion,"" he said. The other important benefit of this scheme is in terms of making farmers credit worthy as financial institutions have assured cash flow for this vulnerable section, he said. The average income of farmers in 2015-16 was about Rs 30,000 and, hence, Rs 6,000 would be 20 per cent, Subramanian said. ""If you have assured cash flow, banker can collateralise that and lend to the farmer up to Rs 24,000 in a year. ""Three four times of a Rs 6,000 assured income can be given to farmers by using the microfinance. What is important is that this is an assured return which has not been done so far. This is something financial institutions can indeed use,"" he added. It will have multiple benefits as it starts from basic premise that you need to be supporting an important constituent of economy which is vulnerable, he said, adding that it is something which is important. Prime Minister Narendra Modi will formally launch the scheme at a farmers' rally in Gorakhpur, Uttar Pradesh, on February 24. The data uploaded on the PM-KISAN portal till February 24 will be considered for transfer of the first instalment at the launch event and the second instalment will be given from April 1.",0

145,"Private players allowed only in infrastructure: Rail MinistryThe Railway Ministry on Wednesday said it has so far allowed infrastructure related investments in the rail sector, which is consistent with the government policy.Reacting to reports on private investment in the rail sector, the ministry said investment in container business was only to the extent of ownership of rolling stock and provision of container services as distinct from operation of such trains, which would be carried out by Indian Railways.As per the government's industrial policy, only railway transport is reserved for the public sector. Rail transport is defined as operation of freight and passenger trains and does not include ownership of track, rolling stock and other related infrastructure, the ministry said in a statement.It also said foreign direct investment up to 100 per cent is permitted under the automatic route in railway infrastructure as long as train operations were not involved.",1
146,"Privatisation must cover the whole rail sector, not just the railwaysEvery indicator, not just safety-related ones, underlines the travails of Indian Railways (IR). An instant solution is also offered. Every monopoly is inefficient, especially a public sector one. Liberalise, privatise, corporatise. Isn’t that how railways were developed in India, through private sector initiatives in the 19th century? Let’s leave aside history, where, the private sector didn’t exactly smell of roses. What do we mean by privatisation and what do we mean by IR? There is an IR that owns infrastructure (tracks, signalling, rolling stock, stations) and there is an IR that runs trains. There is also an IR that runs schools and hospitals, but since this is a non-core function, let’s just assume, eventually, IR sheds that. By privatisation, we may either mean private entry, or selling IR’s equity.Most services on trains and stations (cleaning, catering and maintenance) are already privatised. There is little IR does departmentally. Wagons are produced by the private sector. So, increasingly, are coaches and locomotives. What most people mean by private entry is the private sector running trains. On this, will we contemplate locomotive drivers from the private sector and safety (not to be confused with security) handled by the private sector? That’s worth thinking about. On privately run trains, most people don’t know policy already allows that. Why don’t we see them? There have been private luxury trains. On mainstream trains, there are two reasons. First, there has to minor tweaking of legislation to permit the private sector to charge fares and those fares, after the regulator has been set up, have to be reasonable. Second, any train, public or private, requires a path, from point A to point B. Today, capacity constraints are such that it is impossible to provide that path, for both passenger and goods trains. Sure, after freight corridors, capacity constraints will ease a bit. But fundamentally, easing requires huge investments, which IR’s present financial woes don’t allow. If you want to run a private train from Jodhpur to Jaisalmer, I am sure IR will find you a path. However, that’s not a remunerative segment. The private sector will be interested in high-density corridors, where there are capacity issues. Eventually, when private trains take off, they will run in those high density corridors. Who runs trains elsewhere? Will there be something like a universal service obligation? As a final element in private entry, what about stations? Private management of stations is one thing, private development is another. Private development requires a revenue model. Without land for commercial real estate development (like Delhi and Mumbai airports), it won’t work. At best, given distribution of IR land, this might happen for around 15 stations and no more.Let’s turn to privatisation through selling IR’s equity. Everything isn’t like IRCTC, IRCON or IRFC. A major problem is lack of proper commercial accounting in IR. Before buying something, you need to know its worth. Today, this isn’t possible. With successful pilots in zones/divisions already undertaken, there is no reason why the entire IR system shouldn’t have proper commercial accounting in the next two years. After that, production units (for manufacturing rolling stock) can certainly be hived off. There is no convincing market failure argument for these. But on infrastructure interpreted as tracks, signalling and related matters, all railways have a historical evolution and models imported from elsewhere can’t be easily implanted. It is a vertically and horizontally integrated structure, notwithstanding initial independent and regional developments in 19th century. Therefore, unbundling and privatising this is an expensive and pointless proposition. Once you have taken away the infrastructure, in the form of something like an IR Infrastructure Corporation, and hived off production units and non-core functions, what is left in the IR bit that runs trains, especially after private entry? There is nothing left to privatise there.",0
147,"Rabi cereals production to fall by nearly 10%: NBHCThis coupled with the drought in some parts have impacted Rabi sowing and could aggravate the distress in the farm sector.By Jayashree BhosaleAccording to the first estimate of rabi production in 2018-19, National Bulk Handling Corporation (NBHC), rabi cereals production is expected to decline by 9.91%, while chana/gram is the most affected pulse seeing 9.92% fall in acreage. ""As per our study, the total rabi cereals production for the year 2018-19 is expected to be lower by 9.91 per cent to 115.49 Million MT and wheat is expected to show a decline in area by 2.54 per cent to 29.66 Million Ha and production by 4.99 per cent to 94.72 Million MT owing to scanty and inequitable distribution of rainfall in major growing areas,"" an NBHC release said. The northeast monsoon, between October and December, over the country had been “Substantially below Normal”. The cumulative rainfall in the country during the post-monsoon season i.e. 01st October 2018 to 31st December 2018 has been 44 per cent lower than LPA. Rainfall in the four broad geographical divisions of the country during the above period have been lower than LPA by 51 per cent each in Central India & East & North East India, 45 per cent in North West India and 36 per cent in South Peninsula. This coupled with the drought in some parts have impacted Rabi sowing and could aggravate the distress in the farm sector. The southwest monsoon was almost 22 per cent below normal in the Marathwada region of Maharashtra, while in north interior Karnataka, the deficit was almost 29 per cent and 37 per cent below normal in Rayalseema. In Maharashtra, Vidarbha reported 88 per cent post-monsoon rainfall deficiency, which is the highest in the state. Similarly, drought affected regions like Marathwada received 84 per cent less rainfall, followed by central Maharashtra at 64 per cent deficiency and Konkan and Goa at 56 per cent rainfall deficiency in the post-monsoon period. According to NBHC, rabi rice acreage is recorded lower by 14.17 per cent and its production is expected to decrease significantly by 28.91 per cent due to major rice-growing states West Bengal, Odisha, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh are lagging sowing area. Total coarse cereals are expected to fall by 6.9 per cent to 12.1 million MT in 2018-19. This is due to a fall in production of Jowar, maize and barley. Jowar has seen the biggest fall in sowing, with around 2.52 million hectares, a fall of 18.82 per cent over last year. Area sown under maize and barley fell by 5.67 per cent and 2.62 per cent, respectively. NBHC has maintained that the most affected is the cultivation of pulses, particularly gram or chana. The acreage under gram is down in major growing States of Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Karnataka, which is reeling a drought. The gram acreage has decrease by 9.92 per cent to 9.70 million hectares from 10.76 million hectares in last year. Overall, the pulses have shown decrease by 6.75 per cent and the production is expected at 14.48 Million MT despite kulthi acreage and production increase significantly by 29.84 per cent and 31.23 per cent respectively. Masoor production is estimated 1.76 per cent lower at 1.71 Million MT as against 1.74 during 2017-18. ""However, oilseeds are the only crop which managed to retain last year’s level in terms of acreage with less than one per cent increase. A surge in mustard cultivation in Rajasthan has been critical in taking the total oilseeds sowing area to about 8.04 million hectares, which was 0.71 per cent higher than that in 2017-18. Mustard acreage is expected to increase by 5.03 per cent at 7.02 million hectares likewise production is expected to increase by 4.46 per cent to 8.69 million MT. Groundnut, Sunflower and safflower production for 2018-19 has been estimated to be lower at 0.97 million MT.,"" observed NBHC in its estimate.",0
148,"Rail budget to signal road to reform, says minister Suresh PrabhuThe railway budget will signal the direction of long-term reforms needed to revamp the world's fourth-largest rail network, minister Suresh Prabhu said on Thursday. ""The budget will set the direction of long and difficult road of reform,"" Prabhu told state-run broadcaster DD News ahead of his budget presentation.All eyes will be on Prabhu on Thursday on whether he will raise passenger fare and freight rates in his maiden rail budget to boost the cash-crunched railways and include proposals for Make in India initiatives besides enhancing safety and security.Minister of state for railway Manoj Sinha had earlier ruled out a reduction in fares in the context of falling diesel rates but Prabhu is expected to make a tight rope walk as he tries to bridge the huge gap in finances while presenting the budget in Lok Sabha.Prabhu is likely to unravel his grand plans of how to decrease the cross-subsidy for passenger service from freight earnings which is touching Rs 24,000 crore and the steps to increase goods transportation share in the national transporter with or without hiking fares.India's decrepit state-run train services stand to receive at least a 25% boost in investment to over $9 billion, funded solely by falling fuel costs, according to officials familiar with the railway budget.The world's fourth largest rail network could get even more if Prime Minister Narendra Modi makes it a priority, as China did during its rapid economic growth over the past two decades.There are high hopes that his nine-month-old government will plough money into investment in infrastructure needed to haul the economy out of a rut when it presents its first annual federal budget on Saturday.The rail budget could show how far Modi's India is prepared to drive investment in a vital transport sector.""The fall in diesel prices and a pick-up in freight earnings have given us a golden chance to raise investments,"" said one government official.An increase in the budget allocation would go some way to offset disappointment at the lack of private sector interest in investing in railways, after Modi's government last year suggested public-private partnerships for new routes.",1
149,"Rail budget: There’s a lot riding on rail modernisationSuresh Prabhu covered a lot of ground in his railway budget setting out four goals, five drivers and 11 thrust areas for his ministry. First the good news: No new trains or projects were announced, which means that already crowded tracks will not be further burdened and we will see an improved punctuality of passenger and goods trains. The bad news is that he has shied away from hiking passenger fares which remain abysmally low at Rs 0.30 per km, lower than Delhi Metro’s fare of Rs 1 per km.Leading the 11 ‘thrust areas’ is ‘quality of journey’ for the passengers ranging from providing 17,000 bio-toilets in coaches to 650 new toilets at various stations. He has promised e-catering on 108 trains for passengers to get the food of their choice, apps for train bookings, improved access for the disabled, new helplines for women and the facility to purchase a ticket online in five minutes!He also proposed more satellite terminals to reduce overcrowding of existing ones, but has pinned his hopes on the PPP (Public Private Partnership) model which is a highly indeterminate option and could result in turning over Railways’ land to property dealers. Some new innovations include setting up electronic displays at 2000 major stations to show real time status of trains, of course with private participation which would lead to advertising, adding to the cacophony and noise pollution on platforms.Booking tickets 120 days in advance will undoubtedly help citizens to plan in advance, but a higher penalty for last minute cancellation of booking would have also helped to discourage touts who manage to block tickets during the busy festival season.Prabhu has placed great faith in union transport, highways and shipping minister Nitin Gadkari who would help him with providing rail connectivity to ports. For improving rail safety he has drawn heavily on the Anil Kakodkar report proposing the ATP (Automatic Train Protection) system which will be very expensive.Plans are afoot for roping in PSUs to partner the Railways in providing better connectivity to transport their raw material and finished products such as coal, steel and cement. Prabhu has claimed a good preliminary response but how much this will translate into reality remains to be seen.Businesses will welcome proposals for automatic fare rebate for loading wagons on (empty) return journeys. But the results could be mixed since matching consignments with availability of empty wagons will not be easy and could also result in higher wagon turnround affecting operational efficiency.Suresh has promised to build 970 RUBs (Road Under Bridge) and ROBs (Road Over Bridge) to eliminate unmanned level crossings that caused accidents.Setting up a Logistics Corporation will usher in an era of greater involvement by the Railways in multi-modal transport by setting up new facilities at hundreds of disused goods sheds. Undoubtedly partnering with major private logistics providers will be crucial for the success of the scheme.The only redeeming feature of this year’s rail budget is the fact that at last realisation has dawned on the powers that be, that populism has to give way to pragmatism for regaining the financial health of the nation’s economic life line and a crucial engine of growth!The size of the Plan Budget has gone up by 52% from Rs. 65,798 crore in 2014-15 to Rs 1,00,011 crore in 2015-16. Support from the central government constitutes 41.6% of the total Plan budget and internal generation 17.8%, perhaps the best financial indicator to ensure that the Railways will at last be moving on the right track.",1

We have to move merely providing rail infrastructure to other support services such as technology up gradation, better logistic support and better passenger services in an integrated manner,  said  Rajen Gohain, Minister of State for Railways, while inaugurating an ASSOCHAM conference on ‘ASSOCHAM International Summit on Invest Rail .’ “Need of the hour in Indian Railways is the massive investment and new technology without which we cannot move to become a world class transporter. Thus, the plan is to increase investment to nearly one trillion rupees in the next decade”, said Mr Rajen Gohain. Thus, Rail is the right forum for investment that can address nearly all investments challenges such as ensuring reduced global warming, volatile fuel costs, having lower energy consumption, reducing urban congestion, having less land usage, servicing an aging population and making transportation accessible to all ages across all income brackets. In addition, rail has lower infrastructure renewal and maintenance cost which is often mentioned as 20 times lower per ton kilometre that other forms. “Investment in rail will thus help in the planets sustainable and environmental goals and help in meeting the greenhouse gas emission targets. In addition, rail offers a more stable and sustainable form of transportation. We, in Indian Railways, are thus trying to have a collaborative approach in bringing governments, local authorities, railways and other stakeholders on the same wave length for a more sustainable form of transport system”, mentioned Mr. Gohain. Investing in rail stimulates the economy while reducing CO2 emissions and urban congestion. As many countries worldwide plan to step up their investments in rail over the next decade, we in Indian Railways can and must do more. While India has the world’s fourth largest rail network, it has been outstripped by /china, which now has more than six times as much track following an intensive expansion and modernisation of its network over the past two decades. We are thus also looking in using PPP more- or as articulated in the coming years. We aim to keep people at the centre of all our activities and investments in our journey, said Railway Minister. Indian Railways has one of the biggest network in the world and is recognised as one of the largest organisation under single management. It is also an admitted fact that for the past couple of centuries, transportation has fuelled the world’s economy. In this context, for the country’s economic and environmental health, it is thus time to restore the balance between road, air and rail. Others who also spoke during the conference were H.E.

The allies of main political party used to demand the railway ministry to join the government. The party which came to power at Centre also used the railway ministry as a bargaining tool to distribute trophies to its allies. This is a bitter truth,"" he said. ""Leaders from political parties who got the control of the railways were not interested in (development of) railways and I need not say what they were interested in,"" Modi said.The Prime Minister today laid the foundation stone for redevelopment of Gandhinagar railway station, which will get a face-lift at a cost of Rs 250 crore and will have a 300-room five star hotel built atop.""My government has given priority to railways... it should expand, it should be developed, get modernised and it should bring a qualitative change in the lives of common people.”""We have tried to do this in the last two years and five months. We have increased the budget of railways to double of what it was,"" he said.Modi listed various works done by his government to develop railways and said the pace of doubling of railway tracks has increased, besides speeding up of gauge conversion and electrification of lines. He said free WiFi has been provided at railway stations.The Central government is working to increase speed of trains and also striving to bring in global technology to make railways safer, as ""safety is of greatest concern"", Modi said.""In developed countries, 70 per cent goods transportation is carried out by railways while rest by roads. However in India, 15 to 20 per cent is through railways while 70 to 80 per cent is by roads. Goods tend to get costlier when transported by roads. We are stressing on development of freight corridors,"" he said.The Prime Minister also said that railway stations located in cities can be developed by constructing high-rise buildings atop them.Gandhiangar railway station will be redeveloped through a special purpose vehicle (SPV) formed between the Gujarat government and the Indian Railway Stations Development Corporation Ltd (IRSDC). The proposed name of the SPV is Gandhinagar Railway & Development Corporation Ltd.The project includes redevelopment of the railway station as well as the construction of a 300-room five star hotel atop the station. The hotel, with three towers, will be around 65 metres tall.Railway Minister Suresh Prabhu said his ministry is planning to replicate such redevelopment at 23 railway stations across the country.",1
161,"Railways agents misused demonetisation waivers: CAGIn November 2016, 132 Indian Railways’ Jansadharan Ticket Booking Sewaks (JTBS) took unfair advantage of a three-day-long waiver facility provided by the government to allow transactions at railway ticketing counters after the shock demonetisation order of November 8, and deposited unusually big quantities of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 currency notes on the three subsequent days, a CAG report has found out.The 132 JTBS were from the Central, Eastern, Northeast Frontier, North Eastern, North Western and Western Railway (CR, ER, NFR, NER, NWR and WR) zones. On November 9, 2016, the Railway Board, had issued a directive that the Rs500 and Rs 1,000 bank notes would not cease to be legal tender from November 9, 2016 until November 11, 2016, to the extent of transactions at railway ticketing counters for purchase of tickets, for which complete records were required to be maintained.The CAG report said: “Audit test checked the transactions carried out by 132 JTBSs during 07 November 2016 to 11 November 2016 on 59 stations of six Zonal Railways. A comparison of deposits made by the JTBSs for five days of pre and post demonetisation revealed that post demonetization, total cash deposited by these 132 JTBSs exceeded their normal pre-demonetization cash deposit by significant amounts…”The national auditor observed — “No specific directives/instructions were issued by the Railway Board in respect of cash deposited by the JTBSs in Railway’s Deposit Accounts essential for issue/sale of unreserved tickets through computerised Unreserved Ticketing System. 132 JTBS in six Zonal Railways took undue advantage of the facility provided by the Government of India to allow transactions at railway ticketing counters and deposited specified bank notes with the Railways post demonetisation instead of depositing the cash in the banks”.Started in 2008 in order to cut down long queues at railway stations, the JTBS scheme permits an individual to sell railway tickets outside railway stations. The JTBS charges Rs 1 per ticket but can sell only unreserved tickets and cannot issue concession tickets. ",1
162,"Railways begin work on export policyIndian Railways is working on an export policy under which top officials from the country’s coach factories will be able to visit other countries to seek bulk orders for train coaches. The absence of an export policy has impeded the ability of state-run factories to seek regular overseas orders, after executing the last order for coaches, from Sri Lanka, in 2010-12.The railways is looking at Southeast Asia, the Middle East and Africa for potential customers under the proposed policy, seeking alternative sources of revenue by capitalising on the cost advantage offered by its coach factories, which build train cars up to a fifth cheaper than overseas competitors. The policy will empower officials of the rank of general managers and above to take decisions and sew up deals quickly.“Manufacturing coaches is one part where we have good capacity and we can maintain international standards as well. Also, the cost per coach will be 20-25% less than what is there in other parts of the world. If a policy is in place, we will be able to take frequent orders and our officials won’t have to take approval for every decision. They will be free to take decisions,” said Rajesh Aggarwal, member (rolling stock) of the Railway Board.Aggarwal said that even to travel abroad, an official now needs to seek approval from the railway ministry and Railway Board.“We have been doing exports through RITES, but with export policies, we will be able to take direct orders,” Railway board chairman Ashwani Lohani said. RITES is a state-run consulting company that specialises in transport infrastructure.Railways recently exported the first set of Diesel Electric Multiple Units to Sri Lanka from Integral Coach Factory (ICF) in Chennai. ICF has exported coaches and coach components to various countries like Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan, Vietnam, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Tanzania, Mozambique, Angola, Nigeria and Uganda.“ICF is expecting another order from Sri Lanka railways for export of 160 coaches and the modalities are being worked out along with RITES Ltd. Advanced levels of negotiations are going on between Indian Railways and Bangladesh Railways for export of coaches from ICF,” said S Mani, general manager of ICF.Railway is prepared to manufacture both standard and meter gauge coaches and Modern Coach Factory at Raebareli in Uttar Pradesh is being expanded to increase capacity.“The capacity of coach factory in Indian Railway is good and underdeveloped countries can be a good market for India. But quality should be maintained in order to get good revenue,” said RK Singh, former chairman of the Railway Board.",1

165,"Railways Minister flying high on taxpayers moneyUnion Ministers are busy people, and perennially unsure of their schedule. Or so it would seem from the considerable bill run up by the Union Railways Minister on charter planes and multiple bookings.As part of a series on the misuse of public funds by various ministries of the government of India, an investigation into the workings of the Railways Ministry reveals that rail officials frequently have bent rules to provide charter planes to Union Railways Minister Piyush Goyal since he got the portfolio in September 2017. This has cost the public exchequer 15-20 times more than what it would have cost for the minister to board regular planes.A Railways rule underlines that the Railways can hire a charter plane or helicopter only in case of railway accidents. A minister cannot hire a charter plane for official business unless he is inspecting an accident site.It is also worth noting that Narendra Modi had invoked austerity measures soon after his swearing-in as Prime Minister in 2014. The rulebook states that all government officials including ministers have to fly Air India unless flights are not available in emergency situations. However, Railways officials let Piyush Goyal and his two junior ministers in the Railways, take private airlines instead of Air India.In addition to this, the Minister’s office buys two to three air tickets for the same destination on a given day just to ensure that Goyal doesn’t miss his flight. This expense is paid by the Railways, so essentially it is at the expense of Indian taxpayers.In September 2017, within days of swearing-in as Union Railways Minister, Piyush Goyal’s office put out a request for hiring a charter plane to travel from Delhi to Surat and later Mumbai. In response to the request for hiring a charter plane, Additional General Manager, Northern Railways Manju Gupta wrote to the Railways Board: “The Schedule of Powers, vide para 58 of Part-A (Powers of General Manager), empowers the GM/DRMs to requisition helicopter/aeroplane to reach the site of serious accident for rescue operations expeditiously and to evacuate injured and dead in the event of serious accident. No such powers for hiring/booking chartered flight/helicopter for Hon’ble MR (Minister of Railway) have been given therein.’’Newslaundry has accessed this letter. The letter also states that the Railways Board should put appropriate norms in place since “such demands [for charter flights] may arise’’ in future. The letter proposes that the Railways Board should depute a Railways Public Sector Unit (PSU) to hire charter planes if need be. After receiving the letter, the Railways Board without wasting any time appointed Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation (IRCTC) to hire charter planes for the Minister.Goyal, however, later dropped his Surat travel plan. It is unclear how the Railways Board could appoint the IRCTC to overrule a central government circular. Later, as per Railways records accessed by Newslaundry, IRCTC did book charter planes for Piyush on at least three occasions.Records show that Goyal first flew along with his wife Seema Goyal and his private secretary to Mumbai-Belgaum-Delhi on a three-day trip (February 9-11, 2018), which cost Rs 13 lakh. His second charter flight to Shani Shingnapur-Shirdi-Tulapur (pilgrimage places known for their temples) and later to Latur on April 2 cost Rs 25.50 lakh. This trip coincided with a bhoomi poojan of a coach factory he attended at Latur. And on June 2, he travelled from Delhi to Jodhpur and then back to Delhi on a charter plane, costing over Rs 10 lakh.Goyal’s charter plane seems to have incurred more expenses towards waiting rather than flying if one is to go by the three-day Belgaum schedule put out by his office. A charter plane takes anything between Rs 2 lakh and Rs 3 lakh per hour as waiting charge.According to the schedule, he arrived at Belgaum at 10:00 am on February 10. The charter plane remained parked till 8.15 pm on February 11, and then it took off to Delhi, his final destination. And when the plane was parked, the minister travelled by road to inspect a site of road over-bridge, paid tribute to Mahatma Gandhi at Belagavi railway station, inaugurated UTS Mobile ticketing App over South Western Railways Zone from Belagavi railway station and works to the facelift of the station building.Piyush Goyal also interacted with industrialists and members of Chamber of Commerce. The function went on for an hour to get members’ views on the forthcoming annual budget and Railways infrastructure.It would have cost Goyal less than Rs 50,000 if he had taken a routine return flight to Belgaum, assuming he was travelling by business class. But a charter plane cost taxpayers nearly Rs 13 lakh. The minister inaugurated a Railways App and discussed the budget with businessmen. Again, it should be remembered that the minister is not entitled to charter planes unless he is inspecting an accident site.During his charter flight to Latur in April, Goyal first went to pay homage to deities. “I’m fortunate to have darshan of Shani mandir in Shani Shingnapur this morning; I took blessings of Sai Baba at Shirdi and then went to Tuljapur to take blessings of Maa Bhawani before coming to Latur,’’ he was later quoted saying in his speech. Piyush did bhoomi pujan of a coach factory at Latur and wound up the tour. The chartered flight alone cost the exchequer Rs 25.50 lakh.Piyush and his family visited Shani Shingnapur in the past too. According to his website, he had visited Shani Shingnapur on October 26, 2016, along with his wife and son Dhruv.Moreover, one of his latest trips by a special plane was to Jodhpur, where he flagged off Humsafar Jodhpur-Bandra Express. This cost taxpayers a little over Rs 10 lakh.",1

168,"Railways, Urban Development Ministries To Redevelop Stations Under Smart City PlansIn a major initiative, railway stations and adjoining areas will be redeveloped on Smart City lines for enhancing passenger amenities, easy access to stations, enabling optimal utilization of land at railway stations, as a part of Smart City development. A Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was signed in this regard by the Ministries of Urban Development and Railways in the presence of Shri M.Venkaiah Naidu and Shri Suresh Prabhu. Dr.Sameer Sharma, Mission Director, Smart City Mission and Shri Rajiv Chaudhary, Advisor, Ministry of Railways signed the MoU. Both the Ministers lauded the joint initiative as a historic landmark that brings synergy in development of smart cities since there can’t be a smart city without a smart railway station. M.Venkaiah Naidu said on the occasion that this convergence based city development will result in qualitative improvement in city life. He suggested involvement of local people in redevelopment plans. Naidu suggested that to begin with 10 cities could be taken up for the proposed redevelopment with the involvement of National Buildings Construction Corporation(NBCC) which has successfully executed redevelopment projects on self-financing basis. These cities are : Sarai Rohilla (Delhi), Bhubaneswwar, Lucknow, Varnasi, Jaipur, Kota, Thane, Margao(Goa), Tirupati and Puducherry. This was agreed to by Railway Minister. Minister of Railways Suresh Prabhu said that railway stations have been the core of city development and have become congested over time and their redevelopment offers immense opportunities for changing city landscape. Stating that redevelopment work of Habibganj railway station has already been awarded and plans for Anand Vihar (Delhi), Surat, Bijwasan and Gandhinagar are in advanced stage. He said that several countries like Germany, France, Japan, South Korea, UK and Belgium have showed interest in redevelopment and a Round Table of domestic and overseas bankers will be organized next week to discuss financing of these redevelopment projects. To be implemented first in the 100 cities included in the Smart City Mission, redevelopment of railway stations will be undertaken in AMRUT (Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation) and HRIDAY (Heritage Infrastructure Development and Augmentation Yojana) cities extending the scope of the MoU to over 500 cities. Railway station and the adjoining area in each of these cities will be redeveloped on the lines of Area Based Development provided in the Smart City Mission Guidelines. Average cost of redevelopment of identified area of about 500 acres in the Smart City Plans of 60 cities approved so far comes to about Rs.1,500 cr. The proposed redevelopment involving railway stations envisages improving passenger amenities, easy access to stations, integrated public transport hub, waiting halls and other amenities for passengers, development of residential and commercial spaces, land scaping etc. The joint initiative of the Ministries of Urban Development and Railways widens the smart city development to one more area in each of the mission cities with each city required to select one area under respective Smart City Plans in the first phase. The MoU proposes two Joint Venture options for speedy redevelopment of railway station centred areas. The first being between the Railways and the Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) formed for execution of Smart City Plans, with equal share in equity. In the second model, National Buildings Construction Corporation (NBCC) can be roped in with equal share among the three. NBCC can design, develop and execute the redevelopment plans on self-financing basis. While the Ministry of Railways takes the responsibility of forming Joint Ventures, the Ministry of Urban Development will work with the States and Urban Local Bodies for integrating railway station redevelopment as part of smart city development plans. MoU states that ‘Both railway station redevelopment and Smart City concepts are part of holistic development of respective city. Redevelopment of railway station and its suburbs as part of Smart City Plans leads to an integrated public transport hub around railway station and encourage Transit Oriented Development.” The validity of the MoU is five years to begin with and can be extended with the consent of both the Ministries. Smart City Plans of some cities have already included area based development surrounding railway stations. These include; Bhubaneswar, Thane and Solapur (Maharashtra), Kakinada (Andhra Pradesh), Ahmedabad, Ajmer, Hubli-Dharwad (Karnataka). Smart City Plans of some other cities may potentially impact city railway station and allied services. These include; Jaipur, Kochi, Jabalpur, Visakhapatnam, Indore, Pune, Bhopal, Chennai etc.",0

Of the 54 consequential train accidents in 2017 (between April 1 and December 15), five were reported from ECR.Rescue and relief works in progress after the nine coaches of Delhi-bound Seemanchal Express derailed at Sahadai Buzurg station in Vaishali district, Hajipur on February 3.(PTI Photo)East Central Zone of the Indian Railways, where 11 coaches of the Seemanchal Express (Jogbani-Anand Vihar) derailed on Sunday, is notorious for accidents.In a safety review in December, it emerged as the second-worst zone (of the total 18) in terms of consequential train accidents followed by the Northern Railway. It recorded five such incidents between April 1, 2018 and December 15, 2018. Northern Railway reported eight such incidents during the period. The total number stood at 45.The Indian Railways has adopted a “Zero Accident” policy, and the number of passengers killed in various railway accidents was lowest in 2017-18 (57). But deaths caused by derailments make experts worried. The Railways categorises accidents the following categories: collision, derailment, mishaps at manned level crossings, mishaps at unmanned level crossings and fire.“Bulk of railways’ money goes to staff cost and fuel...there is little left for the maintenance. Derailment of a passenger train is a major embarrassment for the railways, and they must do track maintenance on priority. The zone where the accident has taken used to be called the sleeping division, as efforts to improve tracks were less. This accident is a symptom that tracks and coaching maintenance are faulty and need to be fixed,” said Sri Prakash, who retired as member (traffic) of the Indian Railways in 2009.The East Central Railway comprises Dhanbad, Mughal Sarai, Samastipur and Danapur divisions.

170,"Rain, hailstorm damage mustard, vegetable crops; wheat largely unaffectedWhile the rains will help cut the cost of irrigation for the wheat crop, these are set to affect the output of oilseeds.By Parshant Krar, ET Bureau |Feb 09, 2019, 09.11 PM ISTCHANDIGARH: Heavy rains and hailstorms that lashed north-western India on Thursday have caused damage to oilseeds and other easily perishable crops, mainly peas, potato and cauliflower, in the region. But the main rabi crop of wheat may have scraped through the inclement weather. While the rains will help cut the cost of irrigationNSE -1.73 % for the wheat crop, these are set to affect the output of oilseeds. “Mustard is affected by heavy rains as well as strong gust in several district ,” a senior official at the Haryana agriculture department said. Growers of peas, potato and cauliflower have suffered heavy losses as their crops are affected by the hailstorm. While mustard has taken a hit in Haryana, the weather has damaged the potato crop in Punjab. Wheat is expected to gain from the precipitation, though there could be a marginal yield loss in hailstorm-affected areas. As the wheat crop has not attained height, the wind and rain have not affected it,” an official of Punjab’s agriculture department said, adding: “But hailstorm has affected all the crops.” Officials, however, have alerted farmers about the risk of yellow rust that dwells in wet weather. Hailstorm and strong winds have caused damage in several pockets in districts of Sirsa, Hisar, Mahendergarh, Palwal, Bhiwani Kaithal and Gurgaon in Haryana. The Haryana government has decided to conduct survey of damage to crops In Punjab, initial reports indicate crop losses in Patiala, Ludhiana, Fatehgarh Sahib, Hoshiarpur, Mohali and Ferozepur. “There are preliminary reports of damage to crops, mainly perishables, but it will take a few days for the assessment of the extent of loss,” Punjab’s principal secretary of agriculture, KS Pannu, said.

174,"Rice Exports to gather steam on US, West Asia demand boostRice exports from India are set to swing in the last quarter of this year on a spate in orders after shipments slumped 14% in the last three quarters over high input costs and tepid demand from Bangladesh.By Parshant KrarChandigarh: Rice exports from India are set to swing in the last quarter of this year on a spate in orders after shipments slumped 14% in the last three quarters over high input costs and tepid demand from Bangladesh. “Consignments in January are better than the previous year and the trade is likely to attain levels close to the previous year,” a senior commerce and industry ministry official told ET. Exporters have seen a surge in demand from the United Arab Emirates, Iran, Saudi Arabia and the US this quarter. The official said the supply for exports has streamlined after being affected for the last few months of 2018 because of assembly polls in some states. A bumper yield in Bangladesh also took toll on Indian exports, he said. The 5% subsidy on export value extended to non-basmati rice under the Merchandise Exports from India Scheme (MEIS) in November helped in recovery of trade , but margins remained thin, exporters said. “Raw material (paddy) prices are still high as most farmers are inclined to sell to the state agencies in states, including Chhattisgarh,” said P Baskara Reddy, promoter of Kakinada-based Sri Chitra Agri Exports. He said the exporters hope that the scheme will be extended beyond March 26 and the incentive doubled to 10% under MEIS to complement the shrinking margins. The announcement of higher price assistance by political parties just ahead of the harvesting season in the run-up to the assembly polls had spiked government procurement and dampened private purchase in states like Chhattisgarh where the procurement price was higher by 60%. The non-basmati rice exports that are dependent largely on varieties grown in Chhattisgarh were affected as paddy supply dried up following announcement of higher than minimum support price (MSP). Exporters are wary of such politically motivated price assistance. “Higher procurement price will subdue trade in the coming years. Direct financial assistance is a better route to support farmers,” Rice Exporters’ Association president BV Krishan Rao said. Higher procurement would lead to a surplus buffer stock and a situation where the government will have to auction its stocks at a loss, he said. “Similar situation took place in 1999-2000 when Food Corporation of India had to release its brimming stocks at a discount after higher MSP had boosted federal procurement three-times over the buffer stock norms,” Rao said. The rice procurement crossed 41 lakh tonnes so far compared to 32.5 lakh tonnes in Chhattisgarh in the last Kharif marketing season. “We have not taken export commitments this season as farmers are keen to sell to government agencies,” a senior executive of Uttar Pradesh-based Laxmi Rice Mills said. While export of basmati rice has increased till December, non-basmati exports stayed downhill with 5.6 million tonnes of shipment till December as against 6.3 MT a year ago.",0

The two pilots, Squadron Leader Samir Abrol and Squadron Leader Siddhartha Negi, died on the spot.The arresters installed at HAL airport are expected to stop aircraft that weigh up to 30 tonnes travelling at speeds of up to 160-170 knots. The Mirage 2000 trainer weighs much less, 13-14 tonnes, and was travelling at a speed of less than 160 knots, the officials added.Abrol and Negi were on an “acceptance sortie” of the Mirage 2000 trainer aircraft after it was overhauled by the Bengaluru-based, state-owned company. The sortie was taking place on the HAL runway in Yemalur in Bengaluru on February 1.An HAL spokesperson declined comment. An Indian Air Force (IAF) spokesperson, too, declined comment because of the ongoing court of inquiry into the accident.Read more| ‘My son loved to fly Mirage 2000’, says father of IAF officer killed in crash in BengaluruThe accident occurred a day after IAF chief Air Chief Marshal BS Dhanoa criticised HAL, and also pointed to the number of pilots who lost their lives testing the state-owned firm’s indigenously developed aircraft.According to the officials, the number of times major snags have been detected by IAF at the time of delivery in an aircraft overhauled or manufactured by HAL is high. For instance, last June, an Su-30 was on an acceptance sortie (its 13th) when it crashed near Nashik. The pilot and the flight engineer ejected successfully. These sorties are done by IAF only after HAL has flown the aircraft a certain number of times and cleared them for acceptance.In 2018-2019, the Russian designed Su-30Mki – the mainstay fighter of the IAF – manufactured by HAL required as many as six sorties as against the designated two sorties before they could be accepted. “The increased number of sorties is because snags were found,” a second senior government official said.Read more | Outdated jets for IAF, cheese & wine for babus: Pilot’s brother pens poemSimilarly, Mirage 2000 aircraft overhauled by HAL have, on average, required two sorties more than the mandatory number because of snags. And, Jaguars, the British made deep-strike bombers that are overhauled by HAL, have required, on average, three sorties more than the two sorties designated for acceptance. For the advanced light helicopters (ALH), flown by the Indian Army, Navy and Air Force, and also made by HAL, the numbers are equally bad.“Every aircraft needs to go through a certain number of sorties testing various test points before it can be accepted by IAF for deployment. The fact that the more sorties are having to be flown to rectify the snags indicates either the process of testing is not being done properly by the manufacturer or the process lacks rigorousness at the HAL end,” said Air Marshal SBP Sinha (retd), who till recently was the Air Officer Commanding at the Central Air Command of IAF.Arrester barriers are installed at the end of the runway to deal with exactly the kind of situation the overhauled Mirage 2000 trainer was facing. They are meant to stop an aircraft that has either aborted take-off or made an emergency landing from overshooting the runway with minimal damage to aircraft or injury to the crew.In this case, the Mirage 2000 trainer came down seconds after take-off. The undercarriage of the aircraft was sheared off, most likely because of the impact. And the arrester barrier was the only way that the two test pilots could have brought the aircraft to a stop.The black box of the fighter has been sent to France for a detailed analysis to assist the Court of Inquiry (CoI) that is investigating the crash. “Separately, inquiries are also being conducted on why the arrester barrier gave way,” said a senior HAL official who asked not to be named.",0

177,"Scrap free pass for rail employees’Railway activists on Sunday demanded that perks like free suburban passes for railway employees as well as their families be taken away from both Central and Western railway employees, to save more time and money.They were reacting to the Central Railway’s proposal of limiting the validity of return tickets to six hours. Subhash Gupta from Rail Pravasi Sangh and also a member of CR’s Divisional Railway Users Consultative Committee (DRUCC) said, “Officials said that the idea was proposed to save time and, on the other hand, the railway employees are issued passes that can be used for unlimited number of journeys for free.”A railway official revealed on the condition of anonymity that around 3.5 lakh railway employees and family members avail of this facility in Central Railway’s (CR) head office at CST and Western Railway’s (WR) at Mumbai Central.“The railway passes is resulting in a loss of approximately Rs 7 to Rs 7.5 crore yearly as a result of this facility to its employees,” said the official.The passes include both second and first class but most of the passes get issued for first class,” he further added.Mr Gupta said the railway city officials should discuss the proposal and the passes with the unions.“It is in common knowledge that free passes are not given to not only to the employees but also to the immediate family and it is a burden that the Mumbai railway can no longer bear” he said.“The railway employees should at least get together with the union and discuss the issue,” he further added.",1
178,"Send a message: Pakistan’s weakest pressure points are financial rather than militaryIndia can work with the US, EU and other major powers to impose tough sanctions on Pakistan’s military-ISI elite which drives its security policies and much else in the country.TNN|Feb 25, 2019, 11.16 AM ISTFollowing the Pulwama terror attack Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan claimed he needed “actionable intelligence” on Jaish-e-Muhammed’s (JeM) role, despite the terror outfit itself claiming responsibility for the attack. Since then, the Pakistani Punjab government has moved to take control of the seminaries in Bahawalpur, thought to be JeM’s headquarters. But information minister Fawad Chaudhry claiming these are purely religious madrasas, with no connection to JeM, showed Islamabad up to its usual game of making token gestures whenever international heat is cranked up on it. It does indicate an area of vulnerability, though, which is worth building upon if New Delhi is to inflict a high cost on Pakistan for harbouring terror safe havens. Military strikes are difficult at this point since the element of surprise is gone; moreover terror facilities such as Bahawalpur are likely to have been evacuated by now. But Pakistan is short of foreign currency; indeed its policy of nurturing terror creates chronic internal instability which prevents it from having a viable usual game of making token gestures whenever international heat is cranked up on it. Giving proof to Pakistan on terror activities from its soil has been proven to be pointless by now, but lobbying international agencies has had some success. The UN Security Council has, for the first time, condemned a terror strike in Kashmir and blamed JeM for it. New Delhi must strongly lobby international financial agencies such as IMF or FATF to blacklist Pakistan and deny it financial bailouts, till such time as it can roll up its terror infrastructure. This also serves US interests, as it can roll up its terror infrastructure. This also serves US interests, as it would like to see a stable Afghanistan when it leaves. New Delhi and Washington should work closely together on this. India can, in addition, work with the US, EU and other major powers to impose tough sanctions on Pakistan’s military-ISI elite which drives its security policies and much else in the country. Such sanctions would quickly bring Pakistan around, and the argument for them can be reinforced by putting the international community on notice that further terror outrages such as 26/11 or Pulwama will lead to an automatic military response from India, as India has the right to defend itself and domestic public opinion will not stand for anything less.",0

All the seven persons — four men, two women and an eight-year-old girl — died on the spot. Six of the deceased were in the ambulance while one was travelling in the car, police said.“The ambulance was going from Jammu to Patna and carrying the body of one Zakir Ansari. The driver, Hari Singh from Jammu, was killed in the accident,” said SP Sharma, in-charge of Baldeo police station in Mathura.Police have been able to identify five of the deceased. These included Jehangir Alam 36, Mohd Tahir Ansari, 32, Suhail Ahmad, 30, and ambulance driver Hari Singh, police said.“Those in the car on the other side of divider were from Tundla town in Firozabad.

Saroj Devi, 67, one of those travelling in the car, died on the spot,” Sharma stated.Family members of those coming from Tundla had arrived in Mathura while those related to the occupants of the ambulance were yet to turn up, police said. The injured were admitted to different hospitals, Sharma said.“The exact reason behind the accident is yet to be ascertained.

180,"Smriti Irani in Amethi ahead of PM’s visit, accuses Rahul Gandhi of lyingAhead of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to Amethi on March 3, union textile minister Smriti Irani on Sunday reached the Congress bastion to launch a scathing attack on local MP and Congress president Rahul Gandhi.Her Amethi visit was timed with the launch of the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN) Scheme by the PM in Gorakhpur on Sunday.Distributing Kisan Samman Nidhi certificates to 25 farmers from Amethi in a symbolic launch of cash transfer scheme during a programme at Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya in Gauriganj, Irani repeatedly accused Gandhi of “lying”.Hailing the PM-KISAN Scheme, she said it would benefit 3.80 lakh farmers of Amethi alone. Modi had last visited Amethi on the final day of the 2014 Lok Sabha poll campaign, a visit which political experts believe helped Irani put up an impressive fight against Gandhi in just about 20 days.She had brought down Gandhi’s victory margin to one lakh votes in 2014, down from 3 lakh in 2009. Irani is widely tipped to re-contest against Congress chief Rahul Gandhi in the 2019 LS polls.“Five years back, Narendra Modiji had promised development. He has honoured his promise even as Amethi’s ‘naamdaar’ family only sold dreams to you,” she said after listening to Modi’s radio show ‘Mann ki Baat’.Accusing Gandhi of never raising the issue of “Amethi’s development” in Lok Sabha, she said: “Your local MP never cared about the development of Amethi but about 1.40 lakh people in Amethi benefited through Modi government’s Ujjawala scheme and another 1.25 lakh got the benefits of Ayushman Bharat Scheme which provides illness cover of up to Rs 5 lakh per annum to each poor household.”“The Modi government gave you ‘izzat ghar’ (toilets). In record time, the Yogi Adityanath government in UP has identified poor farmers who would benefit under the Kisan Samman Nidhi,” she said, stressing that only the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) could develop Amethi.She said the Modi government honoured 12 farmers with Padma awards.Irani inspected the venue where the PM would address the people of Amethi and also met BJP leaders who have been tasked with ensuring a good turnout for Modi’s rally.Both the Samajwadi Party (SP) and the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) have decided against fielding a candidate from Amethi and Rae Bareli in 2019 LS polls – a decision likely to benefit the Congress.",0

182,"Spontaneous rail roko hits Central RailwayA technical snag at the level crossing at Bhivpuri railway station triggered commuter unrest at Badlapur Friday early morning.Hundreds of angry commuters gathered on platforms and railway tracks to stage a “rail roko” for nearly six hours, from 5.05 am till such time the protest was called off after a written assurance from the stationmaster. Meanwhile, Amitabh Ojha, divisional railway manager (DRM), held commuters responsible and said he would find out the anti-social elements responsible for fanning the agitation. A CST-bound local got delayed owing to signal failure at Bhivpuri which sparked off the protest. What started as an argument between commuters and the stationmaster turned into a full-blown rail roko. “At first, there were only four railway police present at the station but when commuters stepped in front of the train to stop it and did not budge for half-an-hour, we deployed around 160 personnel on an emergency basis. We were afraid it would escalate into a Diva-like situation,” said an official on condition of anonymity. Initially, a handful of commuters started protesting irregular rail services on Central Railway (CR) but soon, hundreds of commuters, who face the same plight every day, joined in.Passengers stopped all trains plying into and out of the station and shouted slogans against CR. They were in no mood to listen to the railway police or commuters’ association or pravasi sanghatana. Finally, railway minister Suresh Prabhu had to intervene and request commuters to end their agitation.Following Mr Prabhu’s tweet, Mr Ojha reached Badlapur around 10 am and held a meeting with railway officials and the railway police. City police too attended the meeting. The police then tried to get commuters off the railway tracks but in vain. At about 10.40 am, the stationmaster assured commuters that local trains would run on time and would not be delayed. He urged them to stop agitating and allow trains to move.Only after a written assurance from him did commuters call off the protest, and the first train of the day which had been stopped at Badlapur since 5.05 am, started its journey at 10.52 am.By end of the day, CR saw more than 50 services cancelled and more than 65 trains delayed. ""We are expecting even bigger numbers by end of the day. The Kalyan-Thane section had no trains, and we began to run special trains between Ambernath and CSTM/Kalyan, Vangani and Karjat, and Khopoli,"" said another official on condition of anonymity.After train services resumed, Mr Ojha, while speaking with media persons, said that some anti-social elements were behind the protest. ""We are trying to find the people who started the protest at the railway station early morning. We suspect they were not regular commuters but probably some anti-social elements and we will trace them,"" he said. However, no complaint against unknown persons was filed with the railway police till evening.Advocate R.S. Godbole, adviser to pravasi sanghatana, said that the population of Badlapur had increased over the past five years as most people from Mumbai had shifted to Badlapur owing to low-cost housing and clean atmosphere. However, CR had not increased its services proportionately.""There's always a heavy rush of Pune-bound commuters. We need a third and fourth dedicated lane for express trains from Kalyan to Karjat. But the railway board has ignored our demands. Friday's incident is nothing but commuters' pent-up anger that finally exploded. If the issues are not sorted out, what happened at Diva could well be repeated at Badlapur,"" warned Advocate Godbole.Meanwhile, with over 21 local train ferries affected since morning and trains running from CST to Ambernath, most commuters travelled to Ambernath by taking an auto-rickshaw from Badlapur station.Sensing an opportunity, rickshaw-wallahs charged passengers Rs 200 instead of the usual Rs 20 for the Badlapur-Ambernath commute. Kalyan Dombivali Municipal Transport provided five city buses for the Kalyan-Badlapur ferry.",1

The announcement comes just ahead of the Lok Sabha poll dates being declared. As part of the agreement, the Railway Board will give 650 acres of its land at Re 1 per acre, and in turn, the Karnataka government will bear partial costs of doubling two lines, estimated to cost Rs 1,700 crore.In a joint press conference alongside Kumaraswamy, Goyal said the long-awaited rail network connecting 82 stations spread over 160 km costing Rs 23,000 crore will be completed in six years.Goyal said, “The ‘19’ conditions subject to which ‘in principle’ approval was given by Karnataka state cabinet will be ratified, as mutually agreed during the meeting today.”The CM also assured, “In next cabinet meeting of Government of Karnataka scheduled to be held on February 25, cabinet resolution will be passed on the same. GO to that extent will be communicated to Ministry of Railways for further taking up the project.”A statement from the Indian Railways further stated, “Minister of Railways agreed for granting railway land for the project at very nominal lease basis of Re.1 per acre, which will reduce the cost of project by about Rs.6700 crores, nearly by 30 %. Government of Karnataka agreed for unequivocal right of FSI ‘5’ on railway land to Indian Railway for financing of project.Government of Karnataka will approve the entire corridor without any curtailment. It is also agreed by Government of Karnataka will do cost sharing of two doubling projects Baiyyappanahalli-Hosur, Yesvantpur-Banaswadi-Hosur which was initially agreed and later disagreed upon by State Government.”As part of this project, the Kempegowda International Airport will also be connected to the city via the suburban rail system. Out of the 83 stations, 12 including Majestic will have intermodal connectivity with the Bengaluru Metro. The announcement comes after days of disagreement between the state and Centre over the cost sharing of the project. The Ministry of Railways had also expressed surprise at Karnataka increasing the length of the rail project to 360 km without prior intimation.The announcement was awaited as the Karnataka Chief Minister gave an in-principal nod to the project based on a  pre-feasibility report readied by the Rail India Technical and Economic Service (RITES) in January.",1

The seer was heading to Haridwar from Prayagraj (Allahabad). The driver is said to have slept while driving the SUV, which crashed into the truck ahead.UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath and BJP president Amit Shah condoled the demise of Hansdevacharya, who was the leader of the Bairagis campaigning for construction of a Ram temple in Ayodhya at the site where Babri Masjid existed.The mosque was demolished in December 1992 by karsevaks (volunteers) who had gathered in the UP town following a call given by Vishwa Hindu Parishad and supported by the Bharatiya Janata Party to push for construction of a Ram temple there. The VHP and the BJP have maintained that it was the place where Lord Ram was born.The Supreme Court is hearing the title suit in the matter after a judgment of the Allahabad High Court was challenged before it.

189,"Tragedies are becoming far too commonThe Indian Air Force can begin addressing the problem by being more transparent and releasing periodic reports on accidents and their causes.A still from a video footage shows an aircraft in flames after two aircrafts of IAF's aerobatic team Surya Kiran crashed near the Yelahanka airbase in Bengaluru, Feb 19, 2019(PTI)During the rehearsal for the Aero India show currently underway, two Hawk Mk 132 aircrafts collided resulting in the death of one pilot. The tragic news comes close on the heels of a Mirage 2000 crash on February 1, which led to loss of two pilots. A Jaguar crashed on January 28 and a Mig-27 crashed on February 12, thankfully without any loss of lives.The problem of crashes is not new for the Indian Air Force (IAF). The year 2018 saw a number of crashes involving Sukhoi, Jaguar and MIG planes. In fact, the number of accidents that IAF has had with MIGs — 482 in 40 years till 2012 — had earned the aircraft the dubious title of “flying coffin”. The infamy was immortalised in the iconic film Rang De Basanti in 2006.Why are IAF planes so accident prone? One, it is simply the problem of slow movement on defence modernisation. IAF is flush with ageing planes on their last legs. Chief Justice of India Ranjan Gogoi recently dismissed a plea asking for judicial enquiry into the February 1 Mirage crash claiming that the aircraft was very old and “bound to crash”.Two, IAF is known to make its pilots undergo intense and rigorous training. Such a practice puts immense strain on the limited number of aircraft, pilots and the support staff. Three, tardy maintenance and upgrade of some of these planes has also been an issue. IAF puts the blame on HAL, which indeed is running way behind the schedule on a number of projects including the Mirage 2000 upgrade.Four, IAF has to operate in harsh tropical weather which is quite demanding on its planes. Then there are problems such as bird strikes, which, some estimates suggest, are responsible for 10% of accidents. It should be noted that the government scrapped a Rs 250 crore tender for buying bird detection and monitoring radars in 2015.Perhaps, IAF can begin addressing the problem by being more transparent. An annual, or even a triennial, report on accidents and their causes would be a good way to start. Some individual cases may be embarrassing to the service, but an aggregate release of data would do much good simply by shining the light on deficiencies — and ensure that more of its brave pilots do not become casualties.",0
190,"Transformation of railways in NDA budgets Prime Minister Narendra Modi had promised to transform the railways before coming to power, and he has been on track. Though there's still a lot to be done, the railways have managed to shed the image of a state enterprise impervious to change and aloof to its customers' needs. A large number of new customer services has made the railways more customer-oriented while launch of faster trains and significant upgrades of existing ones have changed the look of the railways. In Railway Budget 2014, then railway minister Sadananda Gowda pitched for reforms by proposing private and foreign direct investment and public-private partnership to meet the resource crunch. He proposed the highest-ever plan outlay of Rs 65,445 crore. He also announced plans for introduction of a bullet train in Mumbai-Ahmedabad sector. ""We need huge investment for running bullet train. There was a ban on FDI in railways. Now we would request commerce ministry to delete that clause so that thethere can be FDI in infrastructure development,"" he said. At that time, the announcement did not excite many, but the ambitious project did begin within a few years with a loan from Japan. In Railway Budget 2015-16, the new minister Suresh Prabhu kept fares unchanged and eschewed populist gestures such as new trains and stations in his maiden budget, He preferring to bring a technocrat's focus to try and improve amenities for customers, set the organisation's trajectory for the next five years and put its derailed finances back on tracks. In a historic move, the government merged the railway budget with the general budget in 2017, ending a 92-year-old practice of a separate budget for the country’s largest transporter. The total proposed outlay for 2017-18 was Rs 1,31,000 crore, an 8 per cent increase from the 2016-17 budget. Finance Minister Arun Jaitley announced that a Rail Safety Fund will be created over a period of five years with a corpus of Rs 100,000 crore. He also announced that 500 stations would be made differentlyabled-friendly by providing lifts and escalators. He promised a new Metro Rail Policy with focus on innovative models of implementation and financing, and standardisation and indigenisation of hardware and software. Budget 2018-19 gave a big boost to railways with a capital expenditure of Rs 1.48 lakh crore. ""Most of this money will be spent on capacity expansion, since it is a priority for the national transporter,"" Jaitley said. He proposed a target of doubling 18,000 km of lines and said gauge conversion was underway to eliminate capacity constraints. The minister said 36,000 km of rail track renewal had been targeted in the coming year while 4,267 unmanned railway crossings on broad gauge routes were to be eliminated in the next two years ",1
191,"Trauma care key to cut accident deathsDelhi reported the highest number of fatal road crashes during 2017 with 1,584 deaths, according to the latest available data from the ministry of road transport and highways. In the same year, 6,673 accidents were reported from the city.The AIIMS trauma centre, one of the two level 1 trauma centres in Delhi, receives around 200 to 250 cases daily, the highest in the city. Of these, over 70% are victims of road crash.(Picture for representation)Delhi reported the highest number of fatal road crashes during 2017 with 1,584 deaths, according to the latest available data from the ministry of road transport and highways. In the same year, 6,673 accidents were reported from the city.“The number of traffic deaths in Delhi is high because of the high number of road accidents. And, the infrastructure and the enforcement of traffic rules, along with the pre-hospital care systems, are to blame,” said Dr Sanjeev Bhoi, professor of emergency medicine at Jai Prakash Narayan Apex Trauma Centre, All India Institute of Medical Sciences.The AIIMS trauma centre, one of the two level 1 trauma centres in Delhi, receives around 200 to 250 cases daily, the highest in the city. Of these, over 70% are victims of road crash.And, the numbers might be under-reported.“These numbers are gathered from the police cases registered and are likely to be under-reported. Sometimes patients die days after the case is registered and this may not get updated in the records,” said Dr Rakhi Dandona, who heads the Global Burden of Disease –Road Injuries group for the State-level Disease Burden initiative.At country level, the World Health Organisation’s Global Status Report on Road Safety 2018 estimated the number of traffic deaths to be 2,99,091 in 2016, which is nearly double the 1,50, 785 deaths reported in that year.Injuries to be wary ofMost accident victims suffer from poly-trauma — injuries to more than one system of the body. But it is the head injury that leads to the highest mortality and disability.“Of all the accident cases, almost 40% come in with severe head injuries. And, in such cases, even if the patient reaches hospital on time and receives the best care, 35% die within 48 hours.Of those that survive, half are left in a vegetative state and the rest experience some sort of cognitive deficit depending on what part of the brain is affected. No one is left unscathed. Wearing a simple helmet can reduce the number of head injuries,” Dr Bhoi said.Apart from head trauma, the second most fatal is excessive bleeding. “Around 30% accident victims come in a haemorrhagic shock caused by excessive bleeding. This can be prevented by using a tourniquet. Tying a piece of cloth tightly above the area that is bleeding can reduce the blood flow,” Dr Bhoi said.How to reduce mortalityThe best way to reduce mortality is to reduce the number of accidents, the experts say. For this, there is a need to plan cities better and to improve road infrastructure.“The first step is to ensure that there are no potholes, and there are appropriate speed breakers and signage. And, the authorities should be on the lookout for and fix black spots or areas where a lot of accidents are reported. The pavements need to be improved and the roads have to be made keeping in mind the pedestrians,” said Dr Nutan Mehta, head of the new emergency and trauma wing of Dr Ram Manohar Lohia hospital.Then comes following speed limits taking safety measures such as wearing helmets and putting on seat belts.A study at the AIIMS trauma centre found that only half of the two-wheeler users were wearing helmets, only 45% had fastened it properly, and only 38.5% were wearing a helmet approved as “crash proof” by the Bureau of Indian Standards.Only 32.4% people used seat belts, showed another study from AIIMS. This is because of lax enforcement, which is the key to ensure safe driving practices.“World over, there is enough evidence to suggest that awareness alone cannot ensure safe driving practices. There is a need for strict enforcement so that people face real consequences like licences being cancelled and actually not being able to drive after the licence is cancelled. But, we do not have enough manpower to ensure that all violators get punished,” Dr Dandona said.Poor vehicular standards are also to blame. “Most of the commonly used cars in India do not adhere to the international safety standards. The New Car Assessment Programme (NCAP), which looks at how likely a driver or passenger is of surviving a crash, shows that there are only two or three cars that have a four-star rating, a norm strictly followed in the West,” Dr Bhoi said. And, even if there is a crash, to ensure that a person survives there is a need for a strong pre-hospital and hospital care.“Currently, there aren’t enough trauma care hospitals in the country, which means valuable time is lost and the patient does not get appropriate care within the first “golden” hour of the crash when the chances of survival and minimum disability is the highest. The roads are such that it is also difficult for ambulance to reach an accident site and then take the patient to the hospital in time,” said Dr Dandona.People at riskPeople walking on the roads and those driving two-wheelers have the highest risk of severe injury in road crashes. In India, 40% of all road crash deaths were reported in motorised two and three-wheeler riders and 10% in pedestrians.“In India as in any developing countries, higher number of injuries and deaths are reported in two wheeler riders and pedestrians because of the traffic mix. We have high speed cars moving along with bikes, cycles and pedestrians on the roads. This is because missing or occupied pavements and cycles lanes and the attitude of the people as well,” Dr Dandona said.Also, men outnumber women when it comes to road crashes.A study of demographics of the victims of road crash in Delhi showed that 84% were men and just 16% were women. Besides, almost 50% of the victims belonged to the 16-30 age group.“These are the groups that are more likely to travel for work. The way we have developed the infrastructure of the city, people have to travel long distances to get to work. There are commercial hubs and residential hubs in Delhi. Ideally, people should be working in their neighbourhood. If that were the case, 90% of the people would be off roads in the city,” said Dr Mehta of RML hospital.People in a hurry also lead to a higher number of crashes. Of the 900 accident victims interviewed for a 2017 study, 54.2% reported that they were in a hurry to reach somewhere. The same study reported that 26.1% were having a conversation with co-rider or on a cell phone. Drivers using mobile phones are 4 times more likely to be involved in a crash, according to the World Health Organisation.",0

The IAF is now left with 48 Mirage 2000 fighters.Smoke billows from the wreckage of a Mirage 2000 aircraft which crashed in Bengaluru Friday morning.(ANI)Two pilots of the Indian Air Force (IAF) were killed on Friday after their Mirage 2000 fighter jet crashed during takeoff at the Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) airport here.The French-origin trainer aircraft, manufactured by Dassault Aviation, was on an acceptance sortie after being upgraded at HAL, an IAF spokesperson said in New Delhi. IAF has ordered a probe into the accident that comes four days after a Jaguar aircraft went down in Kushinagar, Uttar Pradesh.First inducted into IAF in 1984, Friday’s crash was the 11th accident involving the Mirage 2000 fleet. The IAF is now left with 48 Mirage 2000 fighters.HAL identified the two pilots as squadron leaders Samir Abrol and Siddartha Negi.Commissioned into IAF in June 2008, Abrol, 33, was from Ghaziabad. Negi, 31, hailed from Dehradun and joined IAF in June 2009.“HAL regrets to inform that one upgraded Mirage 2000 aircraft crashed during the customer acceptance flight at HAL airport here today [Friday] around 10.30 am,” the state-owned plane maker said in a statement.Officials said that the pilots had ejected from the plane but landed on its wreckage.Minutes after the crash, residents from nearby areas posted videos and images of the accident site on social media. The flight data recorder has been recovered from the site.India had in 2011 signed a $2.4-billion contract with Dassault Aviation and Thales to upgrade 51 Mirage 2000 fighters with new weapons, radars and avionics. The first two aircraft were upgraded by the firms in France followed by another two at HAL in Bengaluru. HAL is upgrading the remaining planes.The fighter that crashed was upgraded at HAL, said an official who did not want to be identified.The crash couldn’t have come at a worse time for HAL, as questions have been raised about the capabilities of the state-owned company that is going through financial trouble.Several HAL projects are running years behind schedule, including the Mirage 2000 upgrade programme, much to IAF’s dismay.The Mirage 2000 upgrade is five years behind schedule.IAF’s efforts to support HAL have affected its fighting capabilities, air force chief Air Chief Marshal BS Dhanoa said on Thursday. Speaking at a conference at the Centre for Air Power Studies in New Delhi, he was responding to criticism about IAF’s alleged dislike for the HAL-made Tejas light combat aircraft.Since Independence, 17 test pilots and engineers have lost their lives in air accidents during the testing and evaluation of indigenous planes such as Marut, Kiran, Ajeet, Saras and AWACS (airborne warning and control systems) prototype aircraft.",0

195,"Two striking examples of BMC inefficiency in 1 dayThis week, the newly restored Flora Fountain developed a leak within a couple of days of its inauguration and a short distance away large chunk of Marine Drive caved inThis week, Mumbai woke up to two fine examples of how well the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) runs the city. The newly restored fountain at Hutatma Chowk developed a leak within a couple of days of its inauguration. And a short distance away, a fairly large chunk of Marine Drive, Mumbai’s most famous and iconic promenade, caved in near the crossing where this road turns towards Churchgate station.The general understanding in Mumbai is that no matter what happens elsewhere, Marine Drive is among those areas — Malabar Hill, Breach Candy, Peddar Road, Carmichael Road, Altamount Road, Napean Sea Road being some others — that are very well looked after.The crème de la crème of Mumbai resides in these areas as well as the most powerful, among them leading politicians, bureaucrats, BMC officials and police chiefs. Maintaining these areas hassle-free is not a new development. It has been so historically.Among these, Marine Drive enjoys prime of place. This is the road that gives the city so much of its aesthetic beauty, glamour and character, starting from the outer edge of Girgaum Chowpatty and leading up to the southern end where the Gateway of India stands, taking in its sweep Nariman Point and Mantralaya, where the state’s seat of power is located.How could anything go wrong on this road one might ask? Well, what excellent evidence to the contrary. Or perhaps this is democracy at work, where every area is treated equally badly!And as for Flora Fountain’s short-lived rejuvenation, it makes it easier to understand why we have pipes that don’t take water where most badly needed and waste it elsewhere.If these mishaps were not so serious, it would be almost comical. That this should happen in the country’s leading city, in prime locations and both of them so close to the BMC headquarters, is the deep irony. What hope then for other, less prominent areas?The Marine Drive cave-in was fortunately anticipated in the nick of time, preventing accidents and casualties. What if one or a couple of cars were travelling over the part where the road caved in, it could have led to a monumental tragedy.Flora Fountain’s malfunction was not a threat to life, but was a setback nonetheless and stymied months of effort at reviving one of the city’s major landmarks.It becomes particularly galling when you consider that the BMC is the richest civic body in the country. Its annual budget is in excess of ?27,000 crore, so resources for development, maintenance and repairs can hardly be the issue.Why then should such things occur — or recur — considering that there had been a cave-in on Marine Drive a few years earlier too?The problem lies in the lack of proper planning and detailing of such work that is undertaken – as seems to be the case in the Marine Drive road collapse, as well as callous disregard for completing the ‘last mile’ diligently, as the Flora Fountain setback highlights.Authorities associated with both these projects have been at pains to highlight what has gone wrong. But their explanations don’t wash because all these should have been factored in, leaving zero scope for the trouble that has been witnessed.Accidents can happen and always come unannounced. It is the preparedness for such eventualities that matters.This is where the civic body has been utterly incompetent, for there have been several instances in the past where this has showed up.A diatribe against the BMC, however, is not the purpose of this column, nor is that of much help. A great deal has already been written about the efficiency or otherwise of the corporation. More words will be wasted.Whether the corporation will wake up now, after the recent problems is moot.The more pertinent question is whether citizens will wake up, say enough is enough, and demand stringent accountability.",0
196,"Two, 3-wheeler riders worst hit: WHOThe actual number of deaths, however, could be higher as per the report, which estimates that there were 2.99 lakh traffic fatalities. This means, an estimated 22.6 people per 100,000 population died of traffic accidents in India in 2016.Two and three-wheeler riders accounted for 40% of all traffic deaths in India in 2016, according to WHO’s Global Status Report on Road Safety 2018, which puts the total traffic deaths at 1.5 lakh that year.The actual number of deaths, however, could be higher as per the report, which estimates that there were 2.99 lakh traffic fatalities. This means, an estimated 22.6 people per 100,000 population died of traffic accidents in India in 2016.“The highest number of casualties are reported among people on two and three wheelers, and let me add pedestrians, because they do not have a protective exterior exposing them to more injuries. Also, the kind of speed and traffic mix in India means that cars with higher speed limits drive on the same road with two-wheelers with lower speed limit, making them more accident prone,” said Dr Rakhi Dandona who heads the Global Burden of Disease –Road Injuries group for the State-level Disease Burden initiative.Globally, 1.35 million people died in traffic crashes the same year.“The report shows that progress has been achieved in important areas such as legislation, vehicle standards and improving access to post-crash care. This progress has not, however, occurred at a pace fast enough. At this rate, the Sustainable Development Goal to halve road traffic deaths by 2020 will not be met,” the report stated.The estimated number of traffic fatalities is almost double, according to the World Health Organisation Report, which puts the absolute number of deaths at 2.99 lakhs. In 2016, 22.6 people in every 100,000 population died in traffic crashes.After two and three-wheeler, the highest number of deaths were reported in passengers of cars (12%), drivers and passengers of heavy trucks (11%), and pedestrians (10%) after deaths in two and three wheeler drivers.Looking at the factors leading to fatalities, the report found that India meets “two to six” international vehicle safety standards. The limit on blood alcohol concentration as per the law in India is 0.03 g/dl. Reducing blood alcohol concentrations from 0.1 g/dl to 0.05 g/dl may contribute to reduction in alcohol related road traffic fatalities by 6 - 18%, the report states.However, the maximum speed limit on urban and rural roads in India is 100 kmph. This is much higher than the speed of 50 kmph or less the report was looking at. “A 5% reduction in speed can reduce the number of fatalities by 30%,” it said.“There is a need to take a multi-sectoral approach to tackle road crashes and deaths. There has to better infrastructure that allows for safer travel, better vehicles, improved intervention and enforcement of laws, and a health system that can take care of accident victims. We need to look at the problem from a health perspective. Why should it be under the ministry of road transport and highways?” said Dr Dandona.India is the fourth-largest vehicle producer in the world.",0
197,"Two-year-old survives Audi-dumper crash in Delhi that killed his parents, grandmotherThree members of the Singhal family - Sumit Singhal, his wife Ruchi and his mother - were killed when a dumper truck overturned on their Audi car in in outer Delhi’s Rohini in the early hours of Wednesday.Passers-by look at the mangled remains of an Audi car which collided with a dumper at Rohini, in New Delhi, Wednesday, Feb. 20, 2019, killing three of the four occupants of the car. (PTI)When Sonu saw a dumper truck topple on top of an Audi in outer Delhi’s Rohini in the early hours of Wednesday, he didn’t believe that there would be any survivors in the car. An hour later though, he believes he witnessed a “miracle”.The three adult occupants of the car were crushed to death, but a two-year-old child was rescued with minor injuries. “Hundreds of us had gathered at the spot, but we were helpless. There was no way we could have pulled anyone out of the car. The truck and the soil it was carrying were too heavy for us,” said Sonu, who sleeps on the roadside and sells black salt on a cart.“We thought all inside the car were dead, but then, we heard the cries of a child and we were desperate to help the child,” Sonu said.According to Anurag (goes by a single name), a friend of the Singhal family that was involved in the mishap, a crane arrived about an hour later. The truck was removed and the car’s occupants were taken out of the mangled remains of the vehicle. “Only the child was alive. The others looked dead,” Anurag said.Anurag happened to be at the spot as he was among several residents from the neighbourhood in Rohini Sector 15 who were returning from a wedding in Gurugram. “We were in Gurugram to attend the wedding of the daughter of our former neighbour, Rajesh Goyal. The Singhal family was among the attendees,” Anurag said.Anurag reached the accident spot just moments after the mishap. “The child survived because he was sleeping on the rear seat. The car’s roof probably did not crush him,” Anurag said.The child’s parents, Sumit Singhal and Ruchi Singhal, got married over three years ago. They lived with Sumit’s parents and his younger sister in their five-storey home in Rohini Sector 15. The family had rented out some floors, and also had a thriving pulses processing unit in Bawana.Overloading menaceAs most of the soil being carried by the dumper had landed on the road and the Audi, police said they are not in a position to determine if the “offending vehicle” was overloaded.But investigators said it was possible that the dumper was overloaded. “The truck must have been going at a high speed, and the load it was carrying may have caused it to topple over,” a senior police officer said.According to data from the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways, the menace of overloading in goods vehicles has resulted in 817 mishaps and cost 141 lives in Delhi between 2015 and 2017.At the national level, overloading has been cited as the trigger for 1,94,153 mishaps and 67,349 deaths in the three years between 2015 and 2017. In that period, these mishaps accounted for anywhere between 11.9% and 15.4% of all accidents in India. In terms of deaths, overloading accounted for around 15% of all fatalities.Alok Kumar, joint commissioner of police (Delhi traffic police), said his personnel cannot prosecute goods vehicles for overloading. “We do not have the facility for weighing trucks and their goods because of which we cannot determine if they are overloaded,” the JCP said.",0

The STF busted the mass copying racket during the UP Board examination of physics paper.Police recovered Rs 12.50 lakh cash, solved answer sheets, fake identity cards of 12 invigilators, who were doing duty illegally. Besides, two pistols, 80 bullets, 16 mobile phones, 31 bank passbooks, four physics books, carbon papers and a SUV, from their possession.The STF arrested Yogendra Pal Singh, a school principal and centre superintendent, 12 fake invigilators including one from Haridwar, two solvers, one clerk and a teacher who was the mastermind behind the racket.The mass copying gang was operating at Janata Inter College, Muzaffarnagar and hired solvers from Delhi, Haryana and Uttarakhand were found taking the exam illegally, said police. According to STF, most of the invigilators were not regular teachers. They were hired by the centre superintendent to facilitate copying. These invigilators were teachers of physics, the subject for which the exam was on. This is a clear violation of exam rulebook that mandates that non subject teachers can only be made invigilator.SSP STF Abhishek Singh said as examination was being conducted under CCTV camera vigil and these invigilators were found dictating answer from outside the classroom. A team of STF led by Vimal Gautam along with DIoS Muzaffarnagar raided Janta Inter College and arrested many persons.Singh said after quizzing various people it came to light that one Intekab is the mastermind of the gang. After being interrogated, he revealed that he had large network of copying gang in bordering states of UP like Delhi, Haryana and Uttarakhand.“To help students pass the examination, the gang charges something between Rs 25,000 to Rs 55,000 from each student. Every year nearly 2000 students approach this gang to help them pass the examination. In return the gang makes about Rs 7-8 crore in exam,” SSP STF claimed.SSP, STF, said the teachers were caught solving the exam papers in the laboratory. They were using carbon papers to write multiple copies. They were dictating answers in such a way that CCTV cameras were unable to catch them.",0

205,"24th February 2010: When Sachin Tendulkar rewrote history books in GwaliorSachin Tendulkar is widely regarded as one of the best batsmen in the history of the game and on this day, nine years ago, the Indian superstar etched his name in history books against South Africa in Gwalior.Tendulkar became the first cricketer ever to score a double century in ODIs as he powered the hosts to a series-clinching win over the Proteas at the Captain Roop Singh Stadium.Riding on Tendulkar’s unbeaten 200, India put on a huge total of 401/3 in 50 overs. Depite AB De Villiers’101 ball 114, the visitors were dismissed for just 248 and they fell short by 153 runs.The Master Blaster’s innings included 25 boundaries and three massive sixes and he crossed the 200-run mark off just 147 deliveries at a healthy strike rate of 136.0.Tendulkar was rightly adjudged the man of the match as he showed the way to other that crossing the 200-run mark in ODIs was possible. Following Tendulkar’s heroics, many others took the leaf out of his book and went on to smash double centuries in the 50-over format of the game.India has most representation in this exclusive club as current vice-captain Rohit Sharma has done it thrice during the course of his illustrious career. Rohit’s 264 against Sri Lanka in Kolkata in 2014 also remains the highest individual score in ODIs.Apart from Tendulkar and Rohit, Virender Sehwag is the third Indian on this elite list as he smashed 219 against Windies in Indore in 2011.The other such cricketers are New Zealand’s Martin Guptill (237* vs WI), West Indies’ Chris Gayle (215 vs ZIM) and Pakistan’s Fakhar Zaman (210* vs ZIM).",0

The Government Railway Police (GRP) along with their counterparts at the Railway Protection Force (RPF) recently conducted a security audit of the stations, which revealed that there are at least 1090 unsecured spots between CSTM-Thane-Panvel and Churchgate-Bandra that need quick attention, according to Niket Kaushik, Commissioner, Government Railway Police (GRP).   Owing to heavy and uncontrolled footfall at the railway stations, the ‘minimum standard security’ apparatus continues to be compromised as all the stations have unauthorised entry and exit points. This makes all the stations unsafe and the railways have been informed to plug them, however, very little has been done.  The highest number of vulnerable points, 315, was found in Vashi GRP’s Thane-Vashi trans-harbour line, which is last on the list of security. “The audit is still underway and is being conducted by all the 17 police stations in Mumbai’s suburban section. The data will help to analyse the loopholes and improved coordination among the agencies and police. The concerned agencies (railways and BMC) are being informed about the findings for improving things on ground,” said Niket Kaushik, GRP commissioner.",1
208,"‘Denuclearization’: Donald Trump teases ahead of talks with Kim Jong-unDay before leaving for the upcoming Hanoi summit, President Donald Trump teased the prospect of denuclearization as an outcome with a question mark and said Chairman Kim Jong-un is aware North Korea could become one of the “great economic powers” if it gave up its nuclear weapons.Denuclearization of the Korean peninsula — getting rid of North Korea’s nuclear weapons, essentially — is the chief US goal but the two sides remain far apart on it and President Trump is under pressure to show progress on one of his administration’s signature foreign policy initiative amidst criticism that he has been played so far by the younger Chairman Kim.“I don’t know if North Korea has made the choice to denuclearize,” a senior administration official said last week, previewing summit.Trump leaves for Hanoi, Vietnam Monday morning and will Kim, who is already on his way by train, on Wednesday and Thursday. US and North Korean negotiators have reached in advance and hammering out outcomes, if any, that could include the two countries exchanging liaison offices.Trump and Kim will hold multiple meetings, following the Singapore template from last summer, their first summit — a one-on-one, then one with their officials and a lunch, US officials have said.“We both expect a continuation of the progress made at first Summit in Singapore,” Trump wrote on Twitter Sunday.“Denuclearization?” he ended that post with a question mark.Also read | ‘Very, very bad situation between India and Pakistan’: Trump on Pulwama attackBut did not provide an answer. He went on, instead, reprise for North Korea the prospect of economic prosperity in exchange for giving up its nuclear weapons programme: “Chairman Kim realizes, perhaps better than anyone else, that without nuclear weapons, his country could fast become one of the great economic powers anywhere in the World. Because of its location and people (and him), it has more potential for rapid growth than any other nation!”Complete and verifiable denuclearization by North Korea is the key US goal but experts and US intelligence officials insist Pyongyang has not even made a start yet, though they agree it has also not conducted nuclear and missile tests since the two sides began talking earlier 2018, leading up to the June summit.North Korea is seeking, in return, a peace treaty to formally end the Korean war to replace the 1953 armistice, lifting of economic sanctions, and security guarantees. Kim hasn’t managed any of that yet yet, but his June meeting with Trump has given him a leg up over his father and grandfather, who ruled the country before him, as the first North Korean leader to meet a sitting American president.",0

(PTI Photo)The Indian Air Force (IAF) on Wednesday conducted a memorial fly-past at the Yelahanka air base for Wing Commander Sahil Gandhi, a day after the fighter pilot was killed in a mid-air collision between two British-origin Hawk advanced jet trainers while practising aerobatic manoeuvres for the five-day Aero India-2019.Three IAF fighter jets — a Sukhoi-30 fighter flanked by a Jaguar and a Tejas light combat aircraft — flew the time-honoured “missing man” formation to honour Gandhi at the inaugural fly-past of Asia’s biggest air show.“The formation pays tribute to the fallen pilot. If he was alive, he would have been flying too in the finger four formation,” said former IAF chief Air Chief Marshal Fali Major.Gandhi, 37, was part of the IAF’s renowned Surya Kiran Aerobatic Team (SKAT), which consists of the country’s finest pilots trained to perform complex stunts. Two other pilots injured in the twin Hawk crash - Wing Commander VT Shelke and Squadron Leader TJ Singh - are recuperating in an IAF hospital.A Rafale aircraft of the French air force also made a low pass during the flying display as a mark of respect to Gandhi, who hailed from Haryana’s Hisar. A radio call given by the French pilot announcing this was broadcast over the PA system on the ground. Captain Nativel Babouc, who flew the Rafale in a low pass to honour Gandhi, said, “It was my way to pay homage to the fallen pilot. We fighter pilots are one big family no matter which country we come from.”IAF chief Air Chief Marshal BS Dhanoa said it was too early to say what went wrong and only an investigation would reveal the cause of the accident. The jets were in a mirror manoeuvre – one flying inverted above the other – seconds before the collision that has become the major talking point at the 12th edition of the air show. While SKAT is not taking part in the air show any longer because IAF wants to pinpoint the reasons for the accident, the display team’s Hawks were seen parked outside an apron near the main runway of the air base.Defence minister Nirmala Sitharaman declared the air show open, asserting that it intended to put India on the global map as “a runway to a billion opportunities”.The IAF’s Sarang helicopter display team performed a string of breathtaking manoeuvres amid cheers and applause from the spectators, including ministers from foreign countries, and top military officials including the three service chiefs.Another highlight of the biennial show was a fly-by performed by a B-52 Stratofortress bomber that came from the Andersen Air Force Base in Guam.Of the seven fighter jets competing for an Indian programme to build 114 planes locally under the strategic partnership (SP) model, only Rafales, F-18s and F-16s were part of the flying display.",0

On Thursday, the Congress cited media reports to allege that Modi continued shooting for a film in the Corbett National Park on February 14 for “self propagation”, and stayed put till the evening despite the attack on a CRPF convoy in south Kashmir’s Pulwama district in the afternoon that day.Congress’ chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala, addressing a press conference, also claimed the prime minister continued to “have tea and samosas at seven o’clock in a PWD guest house when every single Indian household didn’t eat food (that day)”.",0
211,"‘Sabka vinaash’: Yogi Adityanath’s take on SP, BSP, and Congress in UPUttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath has said while the BJP’s motto was “Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas”, the opposition SP, BSP and the Congress in the state stood for “Sabka Vinaash” (destruction of everyone).His comments came when a discussion on the budget was underway at the Uttar Pradesh Legislative Assembly.“SABKA stands for SP (Samajwadi Party), BSP (Bahujan Samaj Party) and Congress. Our Sabka slogan speaks about development of all. Their Sabka speaks about destruction of everyone...We stand for Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikaas. Yours is Sabka Saath, Sabka Vinaash,” Adityanath said intervening the discussion.Taking a dig at the Congress, he said, “Every citizen of this country is proud of our traditions. If the Congress had tried to take pride in the country’s traditions, it would not have come to its lowest tally in the state and the country. This situation has come as the Congress had insulted the culture and traditions of the country.” “When you want to garner votes, you show your janeu (sacred threads worn by Hindus). People have even started telling their ‘Gotra’ (sub-caste)... And even the SP did not find the Congress suitable to include it in the SP-BSP alliance,” the chief minister said, targeting the opposition Congress in the state.Adityanath also took a jibe at Ram Gobind Chaudhary (SP), the Leader of Opposition in the UP Assembly. “If you (Ram Gobind Chaudhary) had even an iota of sympathy for the poor, you would have been with Shivpal Yadav’s political party and not with the SP. (Ram Manohar) Lohiaji had spoken about socialism, which is not seen in your party (SP). In reality, it is Shivpal Yadav who takes the name of Lohiaji. You (SP) people do not take his name,” he said.He briefed the House on the various aspects of the budget and spoke at length on the various schemes of the state government pertaining to women, girls, farmers, labourers, youth, villages, electricity, roads, Metro rail, development of airports, health and education.“In a nutshell, I can say that this is a holistic budget. This is a budget which has taken care of the interests of all sections of the society and has given a new impetus to development. This is a budget which has brought smile and prosperity on every face,” Adityanath said.He announced that the state government will soon enhance the honorarium of Anganwadi and ASHA workers, those in the Panchayati Raj Department, village sevaks and cooks who make mid-day meals.Speaking on the recent terror attack in Pulwama that claimed the lives of 40 CRPF personnel, Adityanath said, “The anger which is visible after the Pulwama terror attack is an eye-opener for the public representatives. If a person indulges in appeasement of self-interest, and encourages terrorism, then the same anger will be visible which is today seen on the streets.”The UP chief minister said the BJP government has worked hard to put the derailed system of the state back on track.“UP, which was languishing among the bottom states of the country during the governments of the SP and the BSP, is now on the path of becoming the number one,” Adityanath said.",0

We do not want to be an elitist company. That’s not -- we want to be an egalitarian company and we’ve got a lot of work going on in developing markets,” Williams was quoted as saying in a Burlington Times News report late on Sunday.During his speech, Williams discussed several topics, including the rising cost of the Apple products and inaccuracy of analyst cost estimates.“The stories that come out about the cost of our products (have been) the bane of my existence from the beginning of time, including our early days.“Analysts don’t really understand the cost of what we do and how much care we put into making our products,” he told students.Citing Apple Watch as an example, the tech giant COO said the company “built an entire physiology lab with 40 licensed nurses and enlisted the help of 10,000 participants to further study how calories are burned in various fitness exercises”.According to Apple CEO Tim Cook, there are several factors why iPhone sales are not picking up in the emerging markets.“The customers are holding on to their older iPhones a bit longer than in the past. When you pair this with the macroeconomic factors, particularly in emerging markets, it resulted in iPhone revenue that was down 15 per cent from last year,” Cook told analysts recently.Analysts say they expect some kind of price correction going forward as Apple has given indications that they will look at pricing outside the US closely now.",0

Four of the sixes came off Kevin O’Brien in the 17th over which reaped 28 runs in all.One giant hit off Shane Gelkate went over the stands and out of the ground.Zazai’s stocks have risen dramatically despite missing a place in the Indian Premier League this season.In October, he became only the third batsman to hit six sixes in a T20 over for his Afghanistan Premier League side Kabul Zwanan.He equalled the record for the fastest T20 half century in 12 balls in the same match.Stirling hardly knew who to throw into the breach as a bowler.Boyd Rankin finally claimed a wicket for the Irish when Ghani -- who made 73 off 43 balls -- played a careless shot over long-on that Joshua Little caught diving as he ran in from the boundary.While Stirling and Kevin O’Brien were no slouches, they never kept up with the mountainous run rate, which had risen to 17 by the 10th over.Afghanistan’s star bowler Rashid Khan came on for the 11th over and was furious when captain Asghar Afghan spilled a relatively simple catch off his first ball to give O’Brien a chance with Ireland on 109.O’Brien was bowled in the next over by Fareed Ahmad for a 37 which included two sixes.Rashid bowled Andy Balbirnie in the following over for two and Stirling started to run out of reliable partners.Mujeeb Ur Rahman claimed Stirling -- who as a consolation made Ireland’s top T20 score of 91 off 50 balls -- when he was caught by replacement Najeeb Tarakai on the boundary.The final match of the series is on Sunday. The two play five one-day internationals from February 28 and a one-off Test in March.",0

However, at a joint press conference called by the UD ministry, Delhi Metro and Reliance Infrastructure on Monday, the differences between the agencies emerged.Sudhir Krishna, secretary, urban development ministry, said, “There were no defects in the civil construction when the service on the line started in February 2010.” Sumit Banerjee, CEO (infrastructure), Reliance Infrastructure, countered: “There were damages since day one but they went unnoticed. They came to light during our recent annual inspection.”Meanwhile, the urban development ministry has ordered a proper examination. “Since the magnitude of damage is quite high, it has been ordered to examine all 2,100 bearings,” Krishna said.The ministry and the Railway board have formed a two-member inquiry committee to identify the responsible person/s or agency and investigate in details. As repair of these defects is likely to take a long time, the August deadline for the re-opening of the high-speed line will be missed, officials said.

The Trinamool Congress and the DMK, both of whom have to face assembly elections next year, had to do some shadow boxing so as not to be seen as openly supporting the increase.The opposition, including the Left and the BJP, predictably, went all out to attack the government, demanding a rollback and blaming it for further stoking inflation.Food inflation on Thursday rose marginally to 16.96 per cent from 16.12 per cent last week.For the Trinamool and the DMK, it was a delicate balancing act.Railway Minister Mamata Banerjee stayed away from the meeting of the Empowered Group of Ministers though the increase of diesel prices would directly impact her ministry. Railway ministry officials, however, said that although the the fuel hike would increase its expense on diesel by Rs 470 crore, passenger fares will remain untouched.Fertiliser and Chemical Minister M.K. Alagiri simply read out a note to say that the hike would push up prices of other items further. “Any further increase will hit the purchasing power of the lower middle income families,” he said.When he even proposed a rollback, Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee snapped: “What rollback?” Alagiri fell silent.Banerjee said later, “I am unhappy and we do not support the hike.” But she clarified, “We do not want to quarrel as it won’t look nice. I will talk to the government to reconsider”.The government did consult allies on Thursday before taking the decision.Petroleum Minister Murli Deora spoke to DMK’s A. Raja and Mukherjee had an hour-long discussion with Banerjee. The Trinamool leader made it clear that she will not attend the EgoM as it could send a wrong signal to her electorate.At Friday’s meeting, Agriculture Minister and NCP chief Sharad Pawar said that if the government wanted a hike it must not dither on it. “If God is willing, prices will come down in future.”The Congress was on the defensive. “The government must have been constrained to take this step,” said spokesperson Jayanthi Natarajan.Privately many Congress workers expressed their unhappiness with the hike that is being seen as hurting the aam aadmi.The BJP demanded that the taxes should be rationalised to make fuel cheaper and dismissed the government’s defence that it was the NDA that had started to dismantle the administered pricing mechanism first.",1

The chief minister’s offer came a day after Puri said the Delhi government will have to pay Rs 3,000 crore annually for five years to put off the metro fare hike, set to be implemented from Tuesday.

The report, published in thewire.in, said Shah’s company Temple Enterprises Pvt Limited was “engaged in negligible activity” in the financial years ending March 2013 and 2014 but “jumped to a turnover of Rs 80.5 crore in 2015-16”. The company had taken an unsecured loan during the year for Rs 15.78 crore, the news report said, adding that it finally wound up in October 2016 after posting a loss. Jay Shah issued a statement saying the article “makes false, derogatory and defamatory imputation against me by creating in the minds of right thinking people an impression that my business owes its ‘success’ to my father Sri Amit Bhai Shah’s political position.” Read the story here.Send your child to school or be locked up in jail with no food, water: UP ministerUttar Pradesh minister Om Prakash Rajbhar has warned that parents who fail to send their wards to schools will be locked up in police stations without food and water.

In an unprecedented move, the ministry has brought to an end a 36-year-old protocol where it was mandatory for general managers to present themselves on arrival and departure of the Railway Board chairman and other board members during zonal visits. As part of a massive overhaul of the culture of privilege prevalent in the ministry, the Railway Board has decided to do away with the instructions of a 1981 circular that mandated such protocol.

May and leading lights in the Conservative Party took to the print media on Sunday to warn of unrest paving the way for Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn into Downing Street. May appeared to have survived another threat to her leadership after a bid to oust her by former party chairman Grant Shapps collapsed when it did not find much support among party MPs.

After the win in Ranchi in the first T20 of the three-match series, Virat Kohli-led side can very well hope for another series triumph against the team from Down Under. The dominance of the Virat Kohli-led side in the past few months has shown its potential to be one of the greatest Indian sides ever. It very well reminds of the MS Dhoni-led Indian team that dominated world cricket a little while back. Even reaching the heights of Steve Smith or Ricky Ponting-led Australian cricket teams is no longer a distant dream, it seems. “In the current era there are many teams who are almost at par. So, it would be great if we achieve the same results now, what Australia did in old days,” Dhawan, who remained unbeaten on 15 in India’s nine-wicket win in the first T20I, said.

It has become a victim of coalition politics in both UPA-I and UPA-II. The ministry has become an orphan and is surviving without any protection or guidance,"" BJP spokesperson Jagat Prakash Nadda said.The party, led by its president Nitin Gadkari, condoled the death of over 60 people due to derailment of Kalka mail at Fatehpur in Uttar Pradesh on Sunday.Nadda held Prime Minister, who has kept the Railways portfolio with himself since Mamata Banerjee resigned to become chief minister of West Bengal, responsible for the poor state of affairs in the ministry.""The Prime Minister is squarely responsible for this... It is his weakness that he never intervened when Lalu Prasad and Mamata Banerjee were running the ministry,"" he said.He alleged that the UPA government was ""insensitive"" and warned that ""passing the buck"" will not do.Nadda also blamed former railway ministers Mamata Banerjee and Lalu Prasad for the problems being faced by Indian Railways today.""As Railway Minister in UPA-I, Prasad had made tall claims of profits and given wrong figures. He also projected himself as a management guru at that time. Mamata Banerjee, who succeeded him, deflated his tall claims. But this ministry has now become a joke which is unbearable,"" Nadda said.Referring to the recommendations of the HR Khanna committee, appointed by the NDA government to study rail safety and other issues, Nadda asked why it was shelved.""In 2002-03, the Khanna Committee had recommended a Rail Safety Fund with a corpus of Rs 15,000 crore. The Atal Bihari Vajpayee government had sanctioned Rs 17,000 crore after factoring in inflation,"" he said.Enumerating other achievements of the Railway ministry during the erstwhile NDA government, the BJP spokesperson maintained that 17,000 km of rail track renewal, building of 3,000 rail bridges, upgrading of signals at 950 stations and improvement in security and other policy matters were approved by the Vajpayee regime.He alleged that all these projects were abandoned by the ministry once Lalu Prasad took charge. He further accused Banerjee of contributing her bit to the deterioration of the ministry.""The Railway Ministry migrated to Kolkata during Mamata Banerjee's time. She had a Vision 2020 but we all know her vision right from the time she took office was something else,"" Nadda said, alluding to Banerjee's aim of becoming the chief minister of West Bengal during her tenure as railway minister.The BJP General Secretary said Sunday's accident was a result of lack of long term planning by the ministry.""The Minister of state for railways (Mukul Roy) was not ready to go to the site of the accident. He had to be told by the Prime Minister to go. Railways is suffering due to coalition compulsions. No monitoring of projects is being done. One lakh posts of traffic and security personnel are lying vacant. Political will is needed,"" Nadda said.In his condolence message, Gadkari said the government did not take immediate steps to improve rail safety and the situation deteriorated further. He urged the government to take prompt and effective steps for the safety of people.",1

So what is the harm in paying for a service that will be available on their mobile phone,” said a senior railway official, requesting anonymity.The mobile ticketing for suburban trains was first announced in the 2014-15 interim budget presented in February 2014. However, the project didn’t take off until July — its original deadline.With this service, commuters will be able to book tickets and renew seasonal passes on their mobile. Each commuter will receive a code via SMS after booking the ticket and the money will be deducted from their mobile wallet, which they have to create with the railways.Railway officials are also in the process of creating an interface with banks where the ticket amount can be also deducted through internet banking.The commuter has to insert this SMS code into an Automatic Ticket Vending Machine (ATVM) and procure the printed ticket. The service will initially be available at five stations on the Western Railway (WR) and Central Railway (CR), respectively.On CR, the service will be available at Kalyan, Kurla, Dadar, CST and Thane stations, while Churchgate, Bandra, Dadar, Andheri and Borivli on the WR will have the service.Gradually, these ATVMs will be installed at all stations, said the railway official.Commuter activists, however, claimed the additional charges are not justified.“Railways are not incurring much cost to provide the service. Rather, they should consistently increase the fare and invest in better rail infrastructure and new projects,” said Ashok Datar, transport expert.",1

Roads And Railways ProjectsBy Accommodation Times News ServiceThe Centre gave its green signal for investments worth more than Rs.27,000 crore in new highways and railway lines across the country to boost economic growth.The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) approved infrastructure projects worth Rs.27, 328 crore for expansion of railway lines in 11 states and development of 1,120 km national highways in five states.“The Cabinet decisions are a continuation of the government’s commitment to support infrastructure development particularly expanding the national highways beyond the existing ones,” said Manish Agarwal, partner and leader, infrastructure, PwC India. “This will augur well for passenger and freight movement and is very positive for the infrastructure sector, he said.Infrastructure boostThe government plans to increase its investments in the infrastructure sector. About 8,300 kilometres of roads involving more than Rs.1 lakh crore investments were revived, said Finance Minister Arun Jaitley in his Budget speech. Total investments earmarked in the current fiscal for roads and railways sectors amounts to Rs.2.18 lakh crore. The Centre is also augmenting port capacity by developing greenfield projects in both eastern and western coasts. In the aviation sector, the Centre plans to revive torpid airports.The railway expansion programme includes nine projects involving 1,937 km of track construction at an estimated cost of Rs.20, 867 crore. The projects include construction of second railway line between New Bongaigaon and Kamakhya in Assam. The government also gave its approval to build third and fourth railway line projects on the North South and East West Corridors of the Golden Quadrilateral.The Railway Ministry said the “fully saturated” Golden Quadrilateral will get a “big boost” helping in transportation of coal, minerals, steel and other commodities. This will also enable transportation of more passengers along these routes.“At present, the number of passengers and goods trains in the Golden Quadrilateral section is far more than its capacity resulting in heavy detention. These projects are essentially required for removing capacity constraints, reducing detention and for traffic growth,” the Railway Ministry said.Among the projects approved are third railway lines between Kharagpur and Adityapur (Jharkhand), Itarsi and Nagpur (Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra), Ballarshah and Kazipet (Maharashtra and Telangana) and Vijayawada and Gudur (Andhra Pradesh).Similar third railway lines will also be built between Rajnandgaon-Nagpur (Kalumna) in Chhattisgarh and Gondia, Bhandara and Nagpur Districts of Maharashtra, Mathura and Jhansi and Jhansi and Bina in Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh.Besides, the CCEA has also given its nod to construction of fourth railway line between Jharsuguda and Bilaspur (Odisha and Chattisgarh). The construction of these railway lines is expected to be completed in four to six years.Highway connectivityAs a part of the National Highways Interconnectivity Improvement Project (NHIIP), the government approved constructing 1,120 km national highways in Karnataka, Odisha, Bihar, Rajasthan and West Bengal with World Bank assistance. The work is scheduled to be completed by July 2024 at an estimated cost of Rs.6, 461 crore.These projects will ensure safe, fast and all weather movement of traffic on the proposed national highways mostly located in backward regions thereby improving socio-economic development, an official statement said. In a separate move, the CCEA has also approved waiver of penal interest on the Government of India loans availed by Cochin Port Trust to the tune of Rs.897 crore. The Cochin Port Trust had availed Rs.168 crore worth loans between 1936-37 and 1994-95 for various development activities from the Centre. Non-payment of loans had attracted penal interest of Rs.914 crore, according to an official statement.The Cabinet also approved leasing out 4,060 square metres of Airports Authority of India (AAI) land to Assam Industrial Development Corporation (AIDC) for setting up Centre for Perishable Cargo and its future expansion at the Guwahati Airport.",1
232,"Can we repair the train while it is running?Indian trains run at an average speed of 50-70km per hour — fairly low when compared to the trains in developed countries. Yet, train accidents in India are phenomenally higher in comparison. In 2016-17 alone, train accidents in India have resulted in 238 causalities. This despite the fact that the number of accidents ‘per million train kilometres’ in India has reduced to 0.1 in 2016-17 from 0.23 in 2006-07. Worse still, according to a study by Niti Aayog, six of every 10 rail accidents in India since 2012 have happened due to human negligence.Every time an accident happens, heads roll and a few railway officials are punished but clearly this does not seem to change the scenario much. Therefore, we may need to remind ourselves of how we landed ourselves into this situation and what is that we can do to improve it.Stocktaking must start from a simple acknowledgement that among other things, the Indian Railways has been treated as a political tool by successive governments. Back in the early 20th century, most of the Indian Railways was nationalised but since its budget formed a significant portion of the total finances of the exchequer, a practice of separate Railway budget was institutionalised from 1924 to ensure that it acts as a commercial undertaking having flexibility in financial matters and higher accountability in administration and operation.But over a period of time what evolved out of this arrangement was a split personality for Indian Railways – an observation also made in the Indian Railways Report 2001 authored under the chairmanship of Rakesh Mohan.The report suggests that on one hand Railways was to act like a self-sufficient commercial organisation while on the other, it has had large social obligations to discharge by virtue of the fact it was a government department.It goes without saying that the performance parameters of commercial projects can be quite different compared to social projects. While the former may entail focus on elements like revenue, profits or return on capital the latter may demand expansion of connectivity or increase in traffic.",1

234,"Castor seed production to be down by 20% in 2018-19: Solvent Extractors AssociationBY ET BUREAU | FEB 25, 2019, 01.12 PM ISTPost a Comment According to the castor crop survey conducted by the Solvent Extractors Association (SEA), the total production in India in 2018-19 is estimated to be down by 20% to 11.26 lakh tonnes in 2018- 19 from 14.16 lakh tonnes, estimated in 2017-18. The area and yield have declined mainly due to inadequate monsoons. The survey noted: ""Total area under castor in India for the year 2018-19 is estimated to be 769570 hectares as per the government’s estimates against 2017-18 estimate of 821600 hectare, which has decreased by 7% compared to the previous year. • Acreage has been reported to have declined in Gujarat, the largest growing state, but it is expected to be almost flat in Rajasthan and Andrhra Pradesh/Telangana. • Average yield for year 2018-19 is estimated slightly down, -12.6%, to 1520 Kg/Ha compared to 1740 Kg/Ha, based on farmer’s response about their yield expectation on present crop conditions."" SEA conducts Castor crop survey for crop estimation in major growing states like Gujarat, Rajasthan, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana every year. This year, SEA commissioned Indian Agribusiness Systems Ltd, known as “Agriwatch” in the industry, to conduct a crop estimation study in above states through field surveys and remote sense data analysis. Total area under castor in Gujarat for the year 2018-19 is taken to be 533800 hectares as per the government’s estimates, against last year’s estimate of 591000 hectares, which has declined by about 10% as compared to the previous year. Agriwatch field survey suggests area under castor to be less by 6% this year as compared to last year’s government estimate and is estimated at 554160 hectares. Using remote sensing technique, the castor acreage for the state is estimated at 549000 hectares, for .. The major reasons for lower acreage this year is less rainfall in key growing belt. ""Estimated average yield for year 2018-19 is expected to be 1751 Kg/ha against last year’s estimate of 2029Kg/ha, a fall by 13.7%. Overall, the farmers are expecting decline in yield this year due to weak monsoon, less growth of plants and less availability of water for irrigation. Total seed production in the state with decrease in area (-10%) and less yield (-13.7%), is estimated down to 9.35 lakh tons in 2018-19 from last year’s estimate of 12.00 lakh tons. The seed arrivals have started in mandis as farmers are selling in small lots to get the higher prevailing prices,"" observed the survey.",0
235,"Central Railway block on day dedicated to punctualityIn a major faux pas, the Central Railway (CR) will operate a six-hour block that will lead to the cancellation of 40 suburban trains and regulation of 20 long-distance trains on Sunday, which was dubbIn a major faux pas, the Central Railway (CR) will operate a six-hour block that will lead to the cancellation of 40 suburban trains and regulation of 20 long-distance trains on Sunday, which was dubbed Satarkata Diwas and, ironically, dedicated to punctuality.Each zonal railway was expected to show 100 per cent punctuality on the occasion, which was created to mark Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s two years in power. The initiative comes under the Hamsafar Saptah, which began on May 26 and will go on until June 1.Mr Modi had issued a diktat across 17 zonal railways, in which instructions have been given that they should observe Sewa Divas on May 28 (Saturday) and Satarkata Diwas on May 29. The Prime Minister has asked railway officers to get down to the grass-roots level on Sewa Divas and travel in trains that they run for the common man.The senior officers were also instructed to talk to passengers themselves and understand their grouses. On the following day — Satarkata Diwas — railway officials were supposed to maintain the best punctuality that is humanly possible by showing a scoreboard of 100 per cent.However, the CR has decided to operate a six-hour block from 12 am on Sunday for laying down girders for the Kasaiwada bridge at Kurla.The CR had demolished the bridge back in December last year, fearing a repeat of the Hancock bridge incident.The Railways could not bring in new rolling stock of a much greater height than old trains, as officials were afraid that the overhead equipment would crash into the bridge, which was located between the Suburban railway stations of Sandhurst Road and Byculla.A railway official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, admitted that the block should have been operated a long time ago.“The fact of the matter is the CR should have operated this block way back. It unnecessarily wasted time on other things and no one gave any thought to the Prime Minister’s anniversary and that he might declare some railway initiative,” said the official.Some officials feel that the block should have been cancelled after the railway week was declared by the railway ministry on May 25, but said that they couldn’t deny that if the block of the bridge was not carried out this weekend, they would have had to wait until the post-monsoon period.“Kurla residents are angry as it is because Ramzan is round the corner and the bridge, which is the only connect the east and west, is nowhere near completion. At the same time, it looks like we are going against the instructions from Delhi and saying we have too much work. But we could afford to not operate the block this weekend had the senior officials done the Kurla work on time,” the official said.",1

Jagan Reddy is Naidu’s bitter rival and a strong contender for the chief minister’s post.Srinivas, the father-in-law of actor and grandson of matinee idol NT Rama Rao Jr NTR, evaded a direct reply from the media on whether he would be joining Jagan’s party. Rama Rao was the founder of the TDP.He is reportedly aspiring for a YSRC ticket from either Guntur Lok Sabha seat or Chilakaluripet assembly segment in Guntur district in the general elections to be held this year. Sources in the TDP said Srinivas is a strong contender for a ticket for Chilakaluripet assembly segment since 2004. But Naidu, it is said, did not entertain his requests to avoid criticism of supporting dynastic politics.Jr NTR is married to Srinivas’ daughter Lakshmi Pranathi, who is the granddaughter of Naidu’s sister. The daughter of the chief minister’s sister is married to Srinivas. And, Naidu is NTR’s younger son-in-law. Srinivas founded a regional TV channel Studio N, which was reportedly taken over by Naidu’s son and IT minister Nara Lokesh.Daggubati Venkateswara Rao, the elder son-in-law of NTR, also met Jagan Reddy on January 27 wishing to join the YSRC and eying a ticket for his NRI son Hithesh.TDP spokesperson Dokka Manikya Varaprasad said Srinivas and Daggubati met Jagan Reddy just for seats.Srinivas’ meeting came right after Lok Sabha member P Ravindranath resigned from the Telugu Desam Party and joined the YSRC in the presence of Jagan Reddy.Jr NTR, who took an active part in the 2009 election campaign for the TDP, was allegedly sidelined in the legacy politics which shifted from the NTR family to Naidu after the chief minister took over the party reins from NTR in 1995.The actor’s father and NTR’s elder son Harikrishna, who was recently killed in a road accident, also remained away from party activities after serving the TDP as a politburo member.",0

Demand for cars, two-wheelers, white goods is sluggish. Consumer non-durables, the growth is over 12%. It is the consumer durable which is sluggish and in negative growth,"" he told PTI in an interview in New Delhi.He said manufacturing capacity is there but sentiments must change for buying durable goods.""That is one part of manufacturing. The other part of manufacturing is the core sectors - steel, iron ore, coal, power, minerals. Manufacturing must grow there also. Output must increase. We must produce more coal, more iron ore, more steel, more aluminium. That will happen as the upturn takes place,"" he said.For example, the minister said, coal production has improved while iron ore which is caught in a number of litigations will hopefully clear with Supreme Court hearing the case.""But many other core industries, the projects are stalled which is why we have now identified the projects which are stalled and we are trying to remove these bottlenecks and things will begin to move.""I think work is at pace. A special cell has been constituted. The Cabinet Secretariat is looking at the projects that can be cleared in next few week.If they require a decision by the Cabinet Committee on Investment (CCI), we will bring it. Once the core sector production goes up, you will find the industrial sector moves up and manufacturing also moves up,"" he said.Chidambaram said the Indian economy was taking time to return to high growth trajectory because of the problems in the western economies.""The upturn (in global economy) that is expected has not taken place. At the same time there is no spiralling down either. I think our economy is getting stabilised. There are some weaknesses ... There are signs that we are moving towards a more stable period. It will take time,"" he said.The minister said the upturn will not happen quickly. ""It is a slow climb. The correct approach is to keep the focus on long term. There are no quick fixes. Take measures for long term and while these measures get implemented, the medium and short term will be addressed,"" he said.The government in recent weeks taken a number of decisions like hiking gas prices, setting up of coal regulator and allowing power producers to import coal to meet shortage.""The last few weeks we have taken a number of measures keeping the long term in mind. They will yield result on the long term, but as they yield result in long term the medium and short term problems will be addressed. There will be many more decisions in July,"" Chidambaram said.He said the Union Cabinet will decide on raising FDI caps in different sectors in the second or third week of this month.""Papers will have to come from the ministry of railway, from the ministry of coal, ministry of mines, from Planning Commission, from the ministry of petroleum, ministry of fertilisers.

244,"Data on mishaps suggest railways’ track record has actually improvedIn the past, when there were two sources to find the number of accident in railways, people often tried to match the two, failing to recognise there were definitional differences between themFor purposes of reporting and analysis, Indian Railways actually classifies accidents under several heads – from A to R(AFP)The National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) brings out an annual publication, Crime in India. In the past, this has also been used as source for figures on railway accidents. For example, in 2015, 26,066 people died because of railway accidents and 2,650 because of railway crossing accidents. Since 2016, NCRB no longer publishes figures on railway accidents. It only has numbers on crimes in railways. Therefore, the sole source for data on railway accidents is now Indian Railways (IR), such as Indian Railways, Year Book.In the past, when there were two sources, people often tried to match the two, failing to recognise there were definitional differences between them. Let me give you a quote from the latest Year Book. “There were 103 consequential train accidents in 2016-17 as compared to 106 accidents during 2015-16.” This does not include Konkan Railway. Notice the qualifier. We think IR reports all accidents; but IR reports only “consequential accidents”, or “serious accidents”. What is a consequential accident? An accident is anything that adversely affects the engine, rolling stock, permanent way and works, fixed installations, communications, passengers or railway servants. We usually think of accidents from a passenger perspective. But there are other angles.For purposes of reporting and analysis, IR actually classifies accidents under several heads — from A to R. For instance, A1 and A3 will be collisions of trains carrying passengers; A2 or A4 collisions of trains not carrying passengers; B represents fire or explosion in trains; C, trains running into road traffic and/or road traffic running into trains at level crossings; D, derailments; E, other train accidents; F, averted collisions; G, breach of block (a block is a segment of the track) rules; H, a train passing a signal at danger; J, equipment failures; K, failure of permanent way; L, failure of electrical equipment; M, failure of signalling and telecommunication; N, unusual incidents; P, casualties; Q, other incidents; and R, miscellaneous.What’s the difference between an unusual incident and other incident? N would be wrecking or sabotage, not usually expected. Q6 would be something like “blockade to train services due to agitation”, not something that can be classified as an unusual incident. You can see why IR’s approach to accidents is different. L2 is “no tension in OHE (overhead equipment) for more than three minutes”. This may not fit with our usual perception of an accident, but the effect can be disastrous.Read moreTo improve performance, Indian Railways must streamline the flow of trafficAcquiring land for bullet train project may get delayed, says Piyush GoyalWe are still left with the question. What is a consequential or serious accident? Certain threshold values are defined for loss to railway property and interruption to communications. A serious accident is one where there is a loss of life or grievous hurt to passengers, or those threshold values are exceeded, or where the Commissioner of Railway Safety (CRS) thinks an inquiry is needed. Data on railway accidents are also available through CRS. However, CRS doesn’t enquire into every railway accident and CRS data about accidents only include those where there has been a CRS inquiry.That Year Book will also tell you IR attended to 982 accidents in 2016-17. How can this possibly match with 103? It doesn’t because 103 refers to those that are “consequential”. There are some exclusion clauses that must be noted too: “ (a) cases of trespassers run over and injured or killed through their own carelessness or of passengers injured or killed through their own carelessness; and (b) cases involving persons being Railways servant or holding valid passes/tickets or otherwise who are killed or grievously injured while travelling outside the rolling stock of a passenger train such as on foot board, roof or buffer but excluding the inside of vestibules between coaches or run over at a level crossing or elsewhere on the railway track by a train; and (c) level crossing accident where no passenger or railway employee is killed or grievously hurt unless the Chief Commissioner of Railway Safety or Commissioner of Railway Safety is of the opinion that the accident requires the holding of an inquiry by the Commissioner of Railway Safety.”The exclusion clause makes it clear that a serious accident only includes instances where there is IR culpability. We might want to change this, but that’s the way it is today.The next time you see a figure on railway accidents, bear these in mind. If you want to check IR’s track record, ask yourself what you are interested in. Fatalities and/or injuries on trains, or fatalities/injuries at level crossings? Collisions, derailments, fires? Whatever the yardstick, you will find (a) cross-country, IR doesn’t do that badly; (b) Over time, the performance has improved. Outside the Year Book, there are 2017-18 numbers and they tell the same story.Bibek Debroy is chairman of Economic Advisory Council to the prime minister and a member of Niti AayogThe views expressed are personal",0
245,"Decision soon on removal of Pakistan cricketers’ photos from Eden Gardens: Sourav GangulyFormer India captain and Bengal cricket boss Sourav Ganguly Saturday said a decision would be taken soon on removal of Pakistan cricketers’ photographs, including that of PM Imran Khan, from the walls of Eden Gardens in the wake of the Pulwama terror attack.Ganguly’s comment came after BJP’s youth wing workers protested in front of the Eden Gardens, seeking removal of photographs of Imran and other Pakistani cricketers from the walls of the stadium.At least 64 activists of BJP youth wing were arrested for staging protest in front of the iconic Eden Gardens, a senior police officer said. They were later released on bail.“We are working on it. There will be a decision soon,” Ganguly told reporters when asked about the removal of photos.The state cricket associations of Vidarbha, Punjab and Rajasthan have already removed pictures of Pakistan cricketers in the aftermath of the terror attack which killed more than 40 CRPF personnel. Pakistan-based terror outfit, Jaish-e-Mohammad, has claims responsibility of the attack.Ganguly had earlier backed a complete boycott of cricketing ties with Pakistan, saying not playing the arch-rivals in the upcoming World Cup won’t have much of an impact on the Indian team’s campaign at the mega event in May-July.Days later, Sachin Tendulkar said he would ‘hate’ to give away two points to Pakistan by not playing in the World Cup and India should rather beat them again in the showpiece event to maintain their unbeaten record over the arch-rivals.“He wants two points against Pakistan, I want the World Cup so...he wants two points I want the World Cup. Whichever way you look at it,” Ganguly said, reacting to Tendulkar’s comments.Eden Gardens has photographs of Imran, Wasim Akram and others kept in non-public areas of the stadium.Former and current cricketers have expressed varied opinions on severing cricketing ties with Pakistan.Many ministers of West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee’s cabinet, including former Bengal captain Lakshmi Ratna Shukla, hit out at BJP for trying to divert nation’s attention from terrorism.“We are more keen on removing terrorism from the world rather than pulling down photographs (of sportspersons). The BJP is trying to divert the attention from the current issue of terror attack. This is clear politics going on in the country,” Shukla said.State Municipal minister and city mayor Firhad Hakim when contacted said people should not confuse politics with sports and culture.Former cricketer and current Bengal coach Arun Lal said that the country was going through an emotional time and countrymen were venting out their feelings in different ways.“I can understand the feelings of my countrymen. I also share the same. This is a very emotional time. We have lost some of our brave brothers and obviously the country is hurt.

I have a good news for you all. The AAP government has covered your medical and social security needs by allocating Rs 50 crore in our budget, which will be presented next week. The allocation will be in effect from April 1,” he said.The CM said this amount was not a one-time fund and that it would be an annual allocation, which is likely to increase year on year.In a second sop to the lawyers, Kejriwal promised that after the Lok Sabha elections, the Delhi government would direct the Delhi Electricity Regulatory Commission (DERC) to permanently change electricity connections of their chambers from commercial to domestic.“This will help you save a lot on your electricity bills. The Delhi government has been giving Rs 230 crore as subsidy to lawyers at present to match the difference. Once DERC makes this change in its tariff order after elections, then this subsidy will not be required,” he said.Kejriwal appealed to the lawyers to vote for AAP in the upcoming general elections so that Delhi could get the full statehood status.“Make us win on all seven seats, we will give full statehood to Delhi. We will raise the matter in Parliament. The powers we enjoy now is not even 10% of what Sheila Dikshit used to enjoy in her 15-year rule in Delhi. Now, I being the CM cannot even appoint my own peon,” he said.",0

However, intelligence sources said that explosives, safety fuses, aluminium electric detonators and cords have been found at some of the shut quarries in south Kashmir. “We don’t want to leave anything to chance. It’s not easy to carry RDX, or any explosive material, in a huge amount in a car in a single day. We want to eliminate the possibility of the role of any local mining quarry in keeping the explosives at a safe place,” said a senior J&K intelligence official. Officials believe that the Jaish terrorist could not have brought the entire cache of explosives at one go and was certainly provided logistic support of these business units. Sleuths have also launched a manhunt for stolen vehicles reported between January first week and February 14 following the uncertainty over the make and model of the car used in the attack. Both NIA and J&K Police sleuths have been divided over the car model, whether it was a Maruti Eeco or Ford Ecosport. Did Pulwama suicide bomber hide explosives in stone quarry? PULWAMA/SRINAGAR: Intelligence sleuths across security establishments in Jammu and Kashmir will now be preparing a list of stone quarries that had got shut in south Kashmir in the last few months amid suspicion that Pulwama suicide bomber Adil Ahmad Dar may have hidden explosives in one of these units. Sources in intelligence agencies said while it was likely that the Jaish-e-Mohammad terrorist had used imported military grade RDX from Pakistan in the IED used in the February 14 Pulwama attack, the sophisticated gadgetry could have been provided at one of the local quarries. There are about 30-odd quarries in south Kashmir, including in Pulwama, Anantnag and Shopian. These quarries often use illegally procured explosives and detonators.

250,"Don't mind losing my job, says TrivediRailway minister Dinesh Trivedi had promised a “revolutionary” rail budget to some of his cabinet colleagues on Tuesday. But his party chief Mamata Banerjee smelled a “rebellion” in Trivedi’s budget instead after he hiked passenger fare—allegedly keeping her in the dark—and left him with two options: roll back the hike or quit.For the first time in the history of parliament, the railway minister’s own party opposed the budget and left him in the lurch. Many in the party believe, Trivedi will have to make a quick choice as Mamata Banerjee ruled out any compromise on her “pro-people” stand.Trivedi, however, tried to put a brave face: “I have done my work as the railway minister. Now I leave the rest to the God.”Although fares have been raised across all sections, a roll back in the suburban (2 paise per km), second class (3 paise per km) and sleeper class (5 paise per km) may mollify the Trinamool chief, sources close to her told HT. Banerjee reportedly sees these fare tweaks as anti-poor and anti-aam aadmi.If Trivedi refuses to roll-back and puts in papers before the rail budget is passed, that would be another unprecedented event in parliament’s history. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh will then have to steer the budget till its passage. The option of asking Trivedi to continue till the passing of the budget also remains with the PM. However, Mamata Banerjee may not agree to such arrangement. Poll: Is it time for Cong to part ways with Mamata?A furious Trinamool chief Mamata Banerjee, who had repeatedly warned Trivedi against tinkering with passenger fares in the run-up to the budget, claimed that the railway minister did not consult the party before raising the fares. There was no direct communication between the railway minister and his political boss“As railway minister, he has the right to take own budget decisions. But the fare hike is totally against the policies of Mamata Banerjee and the party,” Trinamool’s parliamentary party chief Sudip Bandopadhyay told HT after a livid Banerjee called him from Nandigram area of West Bengal and vented her ire.Banerjee’s temper reportedly further soared at Trivedi’s praises for the finance ministry. Railway ministry got a loan of Rs 3000 crore from the government to tide over its immediate financial crunch.“Trivedi may shower lofty praises on the finance ministry but that ministry has offered no help to make West Bengal a financially stable state.”Trying to bring the Indian railway back on track, Dinesh Trivedi gets derailed in Trinamool’s political tracks.",1
251,"Drunk drivers are a Delhi policeman’s nightmareDelhi Traffic Police officers say that “hostility” from drunk drivers is one of many reasons why just over 100 motorists were prosecuted for the offence everyday on an average last year in the national capital.Traffic police personnel in the national capital say they are frequently threatened, sometimes assaulted or even mowed down by motorists when they attempt to prosecute drunk driving.(HT?File )“Blow into the alcometer,” the traffic policeman’s order was loud and clear. The SUV driver pretended to blow, but actually held his breath towards the end. The policeman knew just how to deal with the situation. “Loudly count till 10,” was the next command.In the next few seconds, the policeman had scientific evidence of the motorist having 105 mg of alcohol per 100 ml of blood, more than thrice the permissible limit. But what followed next was just what the policeman at the picket near Connaught Place fears every evening.The policeman had to fight off threats of action and repeated phone calls asking him to let go of the driver.This was a relatively much easier situation for the policeman to handle.Traffic police personnel in the national capital say they are frequently threatened, sometimes assaulted or even mowed down by motorists when they attempt to prosecute drunk driving.On better days, a motorist snatches away their alcometer as was seen at Barakhamba Road last November.Traffic Police officers say that “hostility” from drunk drivers is one of many reasons why just over 100 motorists were prosecuted for the offence everyday on an average last year in the national capital.The 37,188 prosecutions for drunk driving in 2018 were 11% more than the 33,343 previous year, but road safety experts say these figures are just the “tip of an iceberg”.“The drunk driving checking is not as frequent and widespread given how rampant the menace is in Delhi. A driver’s judgement is badly impaired after drinking and he is just lucky to reach his destination without harming anyone,” says Piyush Tewari, founder of NGO SafeLife Foundation.As per a study in America, an increase of Blood Alcohol Concentration by 0.02% doubles the relative risk of a vehicle crash among 16-20 year old males. That risk increases to 52 times when the BAC is between 0.08% and 0.10%.In India, motorists are not allowed to drive if the alcohol content is found to be over 30 milligrams per 100 millilitres of blood.According to a late last year’s survey of 5,000 Delhi motorists who drink, 3,605 (72.1%) of them admitted to drinking after driving. The survey, which was conducted by NGO ‘Community Against Drunken Driving’, found that 1,768 of those drivers said they regularly took to the wheel after drinking while 1,837 said they drove under the influence of alcohol only occasionally.More importantly, 78.6% of the respondents said they were not checked for drunk driving in the last six months of the survey.“The enforcement agencies do not take the issue as seriously as it should be. They view it as a seasonal traffic offence which happens during festivals like Holi, Diwali and new years,” says Prince Singhal, the NGO’s founder.According to the 2017 data put out by the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways, drunk driving caused 124 mishaps in Delhi and left 24 people dead and 126 injured. Across the country, drunk driving was the reason for 14,071 mishaps which killed 4,776 people and injured 11,776.But Tewari dismisses the data saying that most drunk drivers get away after causing an accident, leaving investigators clueless about the condition of the driver.“Delhi is a hub of hit and run cases. Many motorists abandon their vehicles after a mishap. When they are caught after a day or two, there is no evidence of drunk driving,” says Tewari.The act of fleeing after a mishap or fighting with the police after getting caught for drunk driving arises from the relatively tough penalties for drunken driving, says Alok Kumar, joint commissioner of police (Delhi Traffic Police).“Drunk driving is one of five traffic violations which lead to seizure of driving license for three months. No motorist wants to part with their license. I haven’t heard of one drunk driver who accepted the penalties without fighting with the traffic police on duty,” says Kumar.What also scares the motorists is the possible arrest and imprisonment up to six months, impounding of their vehicles and penalty of Rs 2,000. “The repeat offenders are the ones who are usually the most aggressive because they can be jailed up to three years and fined Rs 3,000,” says JCP Kumar.Out on the roads, the traffic police officers say they not only face a host of excuses and tricks by offenders, but also violent behaviour that risks the lives of the general public.“Each of these drunk drivers knows some influential person or the other. It becomes very uncomfortable for us to fend them off. In case the driver doesn’t know someone who can bail him out, he will try to take a U-turn or speed away, without bothering about its consequences,” says a traffic police inspector in west Delhi’s Rajouri Garden.JCP Kumar says that after drinking most drivers have a “false sense of bravado” and believe they can drive better.The CADD study found that one in every four of its respondents believed they drive better after drinking.",0
252,"Dubai-bound plane hijacker had issues with wife, wanted to speak to Bangladesh PM:?OfficialsBangladeshi commandoes shot a passenger on Sunday who had tried to enter the cockpit of a Biman Bangladesh Airlines flight after waving a gun and threatening to blow up the plane, airline and aviation authority officials said.The passenger, who had said he had a personal issue with his wife and told the pilot he wanted to speak to Bangladesh’s Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, died later from the injuries suffered after the commandos stormed the plane at Chittagong’s Shah Amanat International Airport, officials said.“We tried to arrest him or get him to surrender but he refused and then we shot him,” said Major General S M Motiur Rahman of the Bangladesh Army.The man’s threat to blow up the plane, which was on its way to Dubai from Dhaka via Chittagong, led its pilots to make an emergency landing.Before the commandos moved in, all 142 passengers and most of the crew had been let off the aircraft unharmed. One crew member had been held hostage, the officials said.Air Vice Marshal Nayeem Hasan, chairman of the Civil Aviation Authority of Bangladesh, told reporters at a news conference that as well as holding what appeared to be a pistol the passenger said he had explosives bound to his body.With the plane close to Chittagong after leaving Dhaka, the passenger stood up from his seat and tried to go to the cockpit, according to aviation officials. When a member of the crew blocked his way, he showed his pistol.He then said he had explosives and if they didn’t open the door of the cockpit he would blow up the plane, officials said. Other members of the crew alerted the pilots to the problem and they asked air traffic control for an emergency landing.It was not immediately clear if he had explosives, though the pistol was real, according to a senior aviation official. It also wasn’t immediately clear if the pistol was loaded or how it got through security at the airport in Dhaka.The security questions are a matter of concern and would be the subject of an investigation, said the aviation official.The man appeared to be in his 20s, and was probably Bangladeshi as he was speaking Bangla, but his identity was not yet clear, Hasan said.",0
253,"Ease in procuring licences makes Delhi’s roads dangerousOut of 10 major cities, Delhi stood sixth in the list of drivers who had procured a licence without taking a test.There are 1,200 unauthorised motor training institutes in Delhi, a plea in Delhi High Court said.(HT?File )Overtaking from the wrong side, inching bumper-to-bumper with the car in front and wrongly navigating the city’s roundabouts — Delhi’s drivers have a lot to learn when it comes to safe driving practices.But if these basic rules were largely ignored, then how did these drivers get their licences?The Delhi government has of late started a major crackdown against the growing corruption in regional transport offices by launching dedicated helplines to report cases of corruption. The ease in procuring drivers’ licences in the city, however, was an issue that was ignored for years.This resulted in the growth of untrained drivers who know little about the rules to be followed once they are behind the wheels.Till very recently, touts who offered to even appear in tests on your behalf for a meagre payment of Rs 3,000-Rs 4,000, were a regular sight at transport offices.“We have a no-tolerance policy for touts who take bribes and offer to issue licences. We conduct regular inspections and have also put up boards for the awareness of people to report such activities,” said Delhi’s transport minister Kailash Gahlot.Startling figuresData released by the Union ministry of road transport and highways (MoRTH) showed that in 2017, around 80% of road accidents in India was caused by valid licence holders.A 2018 survey by road safety NGO SaveLife Foundation also corroborated this dangerous trend. Data showed that 59% driving licence holders in India never took a test and thus did not completely understand road safety rules.Delhi did not fare too well in this test either.Out of 10 major cities, Delhi stood sixth in the list of drivers who had procured a licence without taking a test. At least 54% of Delhiites, compared to the national average of 59%, claimed to have not taken the competency test while applying for their licences.Unauthorised driving schoolsA plea filed in Delhi High Court last year had sought action against around 1,200 unauthorised motor training institutes that had mushroomed in the national capital.The classes imparted by these private schools are usually spread over 15 days and comprise six to seven hours of training and charge anywhere between Rs 1,800 and Rs 2,500.A student, who may have never sat in the driver’s seat, is directly ushered onto the busy and dangerous roads of the city on the first day of the class.“There is nothing to worry. We have full control of the vehicle,” says Hari Lal, a 37-year-old trainer at a driving school in west Delhi.By mentioning control, Lal was referring to an additional set of brakes and clutch fitted into the passenger’s side of the car.“There is no chance of an accident. I’ll apply brakes the moment a student loses control of the steering,” he adds.Many students say they feel confident while being trained, but are clueless while taking their own vehicles on the roads later.“I was caught in a massive jam and just didn’t know how to negotiate my way out. I had to seek the help of another motorist to get out of the situation,” said Deepa Vijay, who was trained by an unauthorised school.Nitin Kumar, an IT professional, said he found the training imparted to be inadequate. “I had to go through the training a second time because I wasn’t taught how to reverse, how to do parallel parking, how to shift lanes or the right use of mirrors,” said Kumar.Kumar said he was never taught how to drive a car on a flyover in busy traffic. “There were many important instructions I never received. I took to YouTube videos to learn important things myself,” said Kumar.But Girish Sharma, president of All India Motor Driving School Association, believes that those trained by even the unauthorised schools are better than those who learn by themselves or are trained by family or friends. He said that barely 10% of all motorists seek training from driving schools.“The trainers are mostly those who quit authorised driving schools or are awaiting licence. They teach their students about road signs, how to handle practical situations, to ensure there is no one in front of or behind the car when they switch start a car,” said Sharma, adding that even the unauthorised school trainers did more good than bad.But Sharma said it was necessary that only authorised motor driving training schools were allowed to operate so that only properly trained people were allowed to teach others.Many learners said that these trainers also doubled up as agents who promised to help them get driving licences easily. “I have to attend the driving test, but I have been assured that I will pass, no matter my performance,” said a learner, who didn’t want to identify himself.Tougher tests and uniform licensingFrom July this year, all states will have to issue uniform licences with security features, which will allow police and security agency to access driver information on the spot. Road safety experts, however, said that the need of the hour is to fix the process of licence procurement.“The process of driver tests needs to be made more transparent. Learners’ tests need to ensure that the applicant knows the basic rules of driving before they hit the road,” said Madhumita Deshpandey, co-founder of Road Safety Records, a Delhi-based research organisation, which focuses on road infrastructure and safety.Recently, Delhi introduced a one-of-a-kind automated track test centre in Sarai Kale Khan. The centre makes getting a drivers’ licence difficult by stimulating tougher driving conditions.Experts also said that certifying driving trainers under government rules will also help ensure the training is up to the mark. In several cities in the US, retired police officials take up the task of training new drivers to ensure that the theory of driving is also mastered.",0
254,"Eight killed in 12-vehicle pile-up on Rohtak highwaySeveral accidents were reported from highways in the Gangetic plains which was covered by dense fog on Monday morning, reducing the visibility to bare minimum.Eight persons, including seven women, were killed in a vehicle pile-up due to dense fog on the Rohtak-Rewari highway in Haryana on Monday, police said. At least 10 others were injured in the accident that took place in Jhajjar district in which over 12 vehicles, including a school bus, were involved, they said.Several accidents were reported from highways in the Gangetic plains which was covered by dense fog on Monday morning, reducing the visibility to bare minimum. Former state health minister Satyanarayan Lathar was killed in Jind after an unidentified vehicle hit him when he was walking home from his petrol pump late on Sunday night, police said.According to police, all the victims in the Jhajjar accident were from Kirdodh village and were going to Najafgarh in Delhi in a jeep to condole the death of a relative there. The jeep collided with a pick-up vehicle and was hit by a speeding truck from behind, police said, adding that the injured were taken to Pt BD Sharma Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences in Rohtak.“Eight persons were killed in the accident that took place in the early morning. At least 12 vehicles were involved in the pile-up,” said Seema Devi, station house officer, Jhajjar police station.The pile-up occurred after the two vehicles collided on Badli Flyover on National Highway-71 and around 10 more piled up behind them due to poor visibility, leading to more injuries. There was a school bus involved in the accident, which led to a two-kilometre traffic jam, but none of the passengers was injured, police said.Seven women and one man who were sitting in the back of the jeep were killed, while two more sitting in the same vehicle were critically injured. The deceased have been identified as Satpal Kumar (48), his wife Kanta Devi (40), Santosh Devi (52), Prem Lata (50), Laxmi Devi (63), Ram Kali (35), Sheela Devi (61) and Khajani Devi (54). They were cremated in the village Monday afternoon amid a pall of gloom.“A woman in Satpal’s relation had died in Najafgarh, for which the entire family was going there to pay our condolence. The visibility was very poor due to fog. Only 20 minutes in journey, we were hit by a truck from behind and all this happened,” said Dheeraj, son of Santosh.The Haryana government has announced a compensation of Rs 2 lakh to the kin of the deceased. “Compensation of Rs 2 lakh will be given to the kin of the deceased, Rs 1 lakh to those severely injured and Rs 50,000 to those with minor injuries,” Haryana minister OP Dhankar said.The northern part of the country, including Haryana and Punjab, has been reeling under the cold wave for the past one week. “Cold weather combined with the availability of moisture will result in foggy conditions over Northwest India. This dense fog is likely to reduce visibility over Punjab, Haryana, North Rajasthan, Delhi and Uttar Pradesh, resulting in difficulty for commuters in the morning and noon hours,” stated Skymet, a private weather forecasting agency.Dense to very dense fog was observed at isolated places over Punjab and West Rajasthan and moderate fog at isolated places over Haryana, Chandigarh, Delhi and West Uttar Pradesh in the morning hours.

These were unserviceable anti-aircraft ammunition.On average, unserviceable ammunition has caused 65-70 accidents annually since 2013-2014.In May this year, an official of the Ordinance Factory died during a routine check of L-70 ammunition at a forward ammunition depot near Pathankot in Punjab. “The accident happened when a validation exercise for L-70 rounds was being carried. The round went off accidentally killing an OF official,” a senior army officer who didn’t want to be named said.Apart from ammunition for the L-70 guns, ammunition for tanks and Armoured Personnel Carriers are also a cause of concern for the Indian ArmyAs many as 19 personnel, including two officers, died when faulty anti-tank mines exploded at the Central Ammunition Depot in Phulgaon in May 2016. Surprisingly, while an internal inquiry pinned the blame on the Ordnance Factory and some of its officials, no was held accountable. Two officials found to be responsible by the inquiry have even superannuated, according to a second Ministry of Defence official who did not want to be named .An audit of faulty ammunition being done by the Department of Defence Production , which supervises the Ordnance Factory, was stopped following the death, this official added. “The Indian army has been promised an improved version of L-70 ammunition fuse next year by the Ordnance Factory Boards. The audit has restarted in July”.The issue is technology, a retired army officer said.“Ordnance factories have not been up to date with the technology upgrades; recently, Indian made ammunition for the newly procured M-777 Light Howitzers malfunctioned causing an accident. Ordinance factories must acquire new technology and maintain better hygiene,” Brigadier S Chatterjee (retd) said.Defence Ministry spokesperson, Colonel Aman Anand, did not respond to queries. Unserviceable ammunition isn’t the only concern for the Indian Army, Ordnance Factories have also consistently failed to produce adequate quantity of ammunition.“The present state of preparedness has created voids due to the limited production capacity of the Ordinance Factory and consistent slippage in production targets,” the Indian Army told a Parliamentary oversight committee on defence last year.Informing the Ministry of Defence and Parliamentary oversight committee, the Indian Army wrote, “Out of 22 items indented on Ordinance Factory Boards, as part of the Ammunition road map, 14 items were not supplied at all.”The Indian Army also asked for the accountability to be fixed on the Ordnance Factory Boards for “poor quality,” slippages” and delays in supply of ammunition.",0

The ministry has asked for a report for implementation of transfer policy for rotation of officials working in sensitive regions to enable vigilance directorate to put the information for the perusal of higher officials.“It is reiterated that all concerned may examine the feasibility of transferring the officials working on sensitive posts at the earliest and ensure that no incumbent dealing with sensitive work continues on any sensitive post beyond the stipulated period as advised to zonal railways from time to time,” said the directive issued by railways.This comes after the Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) issued a directive in August this year reiterating that all government departments should ensure rotational policy on sensitive posts. It further said that analysis of frauds in public sector banks and other organisations show that one of the reasons for such frauds was non-implementation of the rotation policy.             The CVC had asked that all departments strictly follow rotational transfer policy and heads of all departments should ensure implementation of the policy.In 2015, Member of Parliament N F Patole had complained to the railway’s ministry about some officials occupying sensitive posts for over 15-20 years and creating hurdles in the transparent functioning of various departments. Patole also said that about 150 officials were posted at various levels in the Railway Board for over 15-20 years.",1
261,"From white jalebis to INS Vikrant, Naik’s memoir has it allIn a political career spanning over five decades, governor Ram Naik faced several interesting incidents that form a part of his memoir ‘Charaivati-Charaivati’ (Marching ahead, marching ahead) written in Marathi and now translated into Hindi, English, Urdu and Gujarati, which will be released by President Pranab Mukherjee at the Rashtrapati Bhawan in New Delhi on November 9.In Lucknow, his memoir would be released on November 11 in the presence of Union home minister Rajnath Singh and chief minister Akhilesh Yadav.In his labour of love, Naik has included interesting things he had to deal with right from rechristening Bombay to ‘Mumbai,’ use of edible colours in sweetmeats, preservation of INS Vikrant and even finding the Constitution of India written in Hindi on gold leaves!“As an MP, I was required to handle a plethora of diverse matters. One of them was prohibiting sweetmeat makers from using edible colours in their products. Union health minister AR Antulay was among my acquaintances. The makers argued that it would be more reasonable to order them to use only permitted food colours of specified quality. However, if the ban was implemented in toto, there would only be white sweets. Imagine eating white jalebis and pedhas,” said Naik.From sweetmeats to INS Vikrant, Naik quickly changes track and recalls how the INS Vikrant was declared a national monument but it had to be disposed off as a scrap due to the failure of Maharashtra and Central government in preserving the warship that helped India win the 1971 war against Pakistan.Recalling another interesting anecdote, the governor said how his initiative led to Bombay being rechristened as ‘Mumbai.’ And a simple query about the Hindi manuscript of the Constitution of India in the Parliament Library literally led him to the ‘golden book.’“While I was reading in the Parliament Library, I came across the original English edition of the Constitution. Curious, I asked to see the original Hindi edition of the Constitution. Quite an amusing tale unfolded from this simple query. The original Hindi edition was written down by Vasant Vaidya, a Maharashtra calligraphist. Gold plated pages were imported from Germany and a special kind of ink, used for writing this edition, was brought from a reputed firm in China. The writing instrument was a special pen, crafted by the famous Watkins Company, made in Washington State, USA. It had taken Vaidya a full year to complete the writing of the Constitution on the gold plated pages. The Hindi edition is decorated with sketches of Lord Shri Ram, Shri Krishna, Gautam Buddha, Rani of Jhansi and several personalities from our cultural and historic past.”Changing tracks once again, Naik while referring to his tenure as chairman of the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) says, “One of the major assignments of the PAC is to investigate in case of any dubious transaction made by various government agencies after they are recorded by the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG). I created a record by submitting eight reports of PAC in one year. The most sensational of these reports was about the misuse of official aircraft belonging to railway ministry by the then railway minister CK Jaffer Sharief.

One has to be sensitive towards them,” Rana tweeted after he was allotted an upper berth in Suhaildev Express on Sunday night.He posted a series of tweets to express his anguish.“Hum AIIMS me admit hone ke liye jaa rahe hain, 3 passengers me se 2 senior citizens hain, uske bawjood hume upper berth allot ki gayi...Kya senior citizens ko yahi facility milni chahiye?’ Rana tweeted tagging the railway ministry and railway minister Piyush Goel.In his second tweet, he also posted his PNR number and berth details.Rana said thankfully a co-passenger offered his own berth to make their journey comfortable.He was travelling with two other passengers – Munawwar Jafri, 68, and Adil Rasheed, 52 – on PNR number 2726069792 and boarded the train from Lucknow in AC-II.“Railways has to be more sensitive towards senior citizens. All three of us were given upper berth making a sheer mockery of our age,” said Rana.“We were clueless as to how to climb up the berth as our knees are not much supportive,” he said, adding it was insensitive on the part of railways which compelled them to plead for berths from co-passengers.“It’s not our age and stature to beg for berth. What do titles like ‘Saraswati Putra’ mean for us when railways don’t even have the courtesy to respect our age,” he said.Read moreSummer heat can be dangerous for the elderly. 6 tips to protect them65-year-old in Mumbai cheated of Rs17.67 lakh in insurance fraudChief public relations officer, Northern Railways (NR), Nitin Chowdhary said: “Berth allocation system is programmed in a manner to give priority to senior citizens and female passengers in allocation of lower berths. However, once the lower berths get reserved, there is no choice but to allocate upper berths.”“As per the allocation system in AC-II, there is a provision to allocate only three lower berths on first come, first serve basis. It can be a woman above 45 years, a pregnant woman or any senior citizen,” he said.First Published: Apr 24, 2018 12:50 IST",1
263,"Govt mulls pvt role in rly, scrapping of fare subsidyScrapping the railway board, merging the rail budget with the main budget and withdrawing the passenger fare subsidy are among the radical reform proposals the government is considering, official sources said.Railways minister DV Sadananda Gowda is also contemplating a role for private stakeholders in policy-making and lateral entry for IAS officers into the top rail hierarchy to “de-centralise and corporatize” the functioning of the public transporter, which carries roughly 23 million passengers daily.“The railways served the nation well in the initial decades after Independence, but its administrative and institutional structure and functioning seems archaic and unscientific in the present context and needs overhaul. These tasks are huge and difficult and will need to be attempted progressively,” Rail Restructuring Committee chairman Bibek Debroy told HT.The committee was set up recently by the Indian Railways to take forward Gowda’s budget announcements on restructuring the rail ministry and railway board.All these reform proposals have been mentioned in the reports of several expert committees.A top government priority is to replace the “outdated and flexible” accounting practices with a professional “corporate accounting” system that can provide scientific data on the profits and losses of rail operations, the sources said.“The railways must eventually work towards… charging passenger fares commensurate with expenses incurred in providing for the cost of travel. But the progressive hike in fares will also have to be matched with better passenger amenities,” Debroy said.Currently, passenger fares are hugely subsidized, resulting in an annual loss of Rs. 25,000 crore in this segment. A proposal to merge the railways’ nine different cadre and provide for a single, unified cadre — to be called the Indian Railway Service — is also part of the surgical operation plan.",1
264,"Green patches, seats at regular intervals increase walkability quotientWhile on the one hand, Delhi has some of the most beautiful and pedestrian-friendly roads such as Sardar Patel Marg or Kasturba Gandhi Marg, it also has stretches such as the one between ISBT Kashmere Gate and Majnu Ka Tilla, where pedestrians are forced to walk on the main roads and risk their lives due to the lack of walkable footpath.Experts say greenery should be maintained round the year to make footpaths walkable. (Amal KS/HT Photo )Mention the word ‘walkability’ and it immediately conjures up an image of a foreign city such as Paris and London — with people walking on wide footpaths adorned with lush green trees and hedges, seats at regular intervals and colourful shops and eateries along the way. But a careful glance at our city will tell you that Delhi doesn’t have to look beyond its territory to understand what the term entails.While on the one hand, Delhi has some of the most beautiful and pedestrian-friendly roads such as Sardar Patel Marg or Kasturba Gandhi Marg with their canopy of trees, broad sideways with well-laid green patches, on the other hand, it also has stretches such as the one between ISBT Kashmere Gate and Majnu Ka Tilla, where pedestrians are forced to walk on the main roads and risk their lives due to the lack of walkable footpath.Elaborating on the issue, architect and urban planner, AGK Menon, said, “A walkable road needs proper planning and integration of greenery, aesthetics, safety and public utility right from the planning stages. But unfortunately, most roads in the city sans the ones in Lutyens’ Delhi lack this. Sometimes, you see a bus stop right in the middle of the footpath, sometimes, there are no trees to provide pedestrians with shade, and at times, the footpaths are dug up.”But then, one might ask, what does greenery have to do with walkability.The connectionA study conducted by the Delhi Traffic Police in 2016 revealed that road accidents in the New Delhi area — which has massive green coverage and continuous walking facilities for pedestrians — was at least 40 per cent lower than the rest of the city. It also showed that pedestrian deaths in accidents in this area were almost 85 per cent lower.The connection between green coverage and road accidents was first established by the government of Mexico City in 2015, which assessed some of the busiest and the most accident-prone stretches, for over a decade and increased the green coverage there. After the project was completed, it was seen that not only were accidents on the stretch controlled but also that incidents of road rage among drivers had gone down.In a statement released to the local media, the Mexico City government had said the green cover “had acted as a stress buster for drivers” who were otherwise more aggressive on roads. This, they said, became a boon for pedestrians, who had also found the newly developed area more accessible.“Greenery along sideways and footpaths not just provides shade and increases your convenience while walking, it also soothes your senses and keeps you happy and calm. The moment you start walking with your senses feeling the surrounding, it slows you down and acts as a recreation for you. The hedges along edges of footpaths keep you from getting down on the roads, thereby bringing down the chances of accidents,” said KT Ravindran, urban designer and former chairman of the Delhi Urban Art Commission.Curbing pollution woesThere are umpteen studies that have revealed how greenery along roads and footpaths could help bring down pollution. A latest study by researchers from the University of Surrey has shown that hedges can bring down vehicular pollution by more than 60 per cent.In 2009, the Indian Road Congress (IRC) had laid down certain guidelines and objectives that need to be followed while selecting plants.“The objectives while selecting a plant species — as laid down in the IRC — are to reduce air and dust pollution, arrest soil erosion, mitigate extreme climatic conditions, reduce noise pollution, among others. But these are hardly followed in plantation drives,” RNS Tyagi, former horticulture director of the Central Public Works Department, said.Experts said a mix-and-match of big canopy trees and hedges are ideal for footpaths. It, in fact, make roads more walkable.“Just like we need woods and greenery, we also need open spaces. Both are important for us. And for this, we need a proper plan. We can’t just go on planting trees just for the sake of greenery,” author and conservationist, Pradip Krishen, said.Moving aheadSo how exactly do we go ahead? Experts said that to integrate greenery with roads so that they could become more walkable should be the primary objective among planners right from the initial stages.“A major criterion while making a city or its roads walkable is to see that the walkbale streets do not end abruptly. They should have some continuity and end in open spaces such as a park,” said Ravindran.Planners also said the more interactive a footpath -- with lots of greenery instead of a mundane looking road with ‘dead’ walls — the more it will increase walkability.“If the road has spaces with greenery, shops and eateries, which a pedestrian can see, walkabilty increases. A dull road with walls blocking your sight reduces the walkability quotient,” Ravindran maintained.But just planting trees and hedges won’t help. Experts said that in an attempt to make roads and footpaths more walkable, greenery should be maintained round the year. Unless maintained, these green stretches could become shady dark places and become unsafe.“Whenever we think of widening a road or coming up with an infrastructure project, the first thing we see is that trees are chopped off. Sometimes, when footpaths are retrofitted, the bases of trees are all concretised despite a National Green Tribunal (NGT) ruling against such practices. Residents should be involved so that greeneries could be maintained more efficiently,” said Kanchi Kohli, legal researcher at Centre for Policy Research.",0

My eight-year-old son played with snow throughout the way.”Groom along with his family treks to Makku Math in Rudraprayag district for his wedding ceremony after roads were blocked due to heavy snow. (HT Photo)A wedding ceremony with only 25 people is rare in Uttarakhand, but one such wedding took place on Friday at Makku Math in Rudraprayag after the groom along with his relatives walked for over 6km in heavy snow to attend the ceremony.Around 80 people had left for from Triyuginarayan village in the district to attend Rajnish Kurmachali’s wedding ceremony at Makku Math, but were stuck in traffic after vehicular roads were closed due to snow. The family then decided to send only those people who were needed for the rituals such as the groom’s maternal uncle, sisters and some elderly people. The dolled up family undertook a 6km long unique marriage procession, with children playing in the snow to reach their destination.“We had seen a wedding procession like this in 2002 and now this was the next one. People will talk about this procession and the wedding for years as in both the weddings the groom was an army jawan,” said Ashish Gairola, the groom’s brother.Speaking on whether the journey was difficult for the family, Gairola said, “If you see the pictures then you would question whether they were even feeling cold, forget difficulty. My eight-year-old son played with snow throughout the way.”Since the last seven days, the village has not received power supply, making it difficult for them to carry out daily chores. The groom’s brother added that people have been charging their phone batteries through their cars due to power outage.Bijay Lal, head of Triyuginarayan village said, “Even I had to go to the wedding but were all stuck due to the snow. But those who went enjoyed the whole journey and the wedding took place without any problem.”Mangesh Ghildilyal, district magistrate of Rudraprayag said, ""We received information about this wedding where people had to walk all the way. It is good that they walked, as due to continuous snowfall, there are high chances of accident as cars can skid."" He added that machines have been deployed to clear the snow in the village but due to incessant snowfall the roads are still blocked.",0

In an exclusive interview with HT, Nishant threw light on what makes the show stand out from others, why it’s tough to work in the television industry and more.Actor Nishant Malkani is 31 and portrays the role of a father to three grown up men on TV show Guddan Tumse Na Ho Payega. With no grey hair in sight, the actor is seen as the husband of 20-year-old Guddan who owns the title of India’s youngest mother-in-law. In an exclusive interview with HT, Nishant threw light on what makes the show stand out from others, why it’s tough to work in the television industry and more. Excerpts:Tell us more about the show Guddan Tumse Na Ho Payega.The story is about a man and a woman who meet accidently and go on to tie the knot. Both of them are poles apart. While the woman is around 20 years old, the man is in his mid-thirties. The woman is very innocent and even though she has good intentions, she ends up screwing everything. On the other hand, this man is very mature but is still in love with his first wife. They get married accidently due to unexpected circumstances. This man is the adopted son of the family and ends up being a father to three sons and a father-in-law to their wives. So when he marries Guddan, she ends up becoming their mother-in-law as well (as told in the show’s tagline – Guddan India ki youngest saas hain).You play a father to three grown up men in the show. Were you not apprehensive about playing such a role?Initially, I was apprehensive but the makers convinced me about the theme of the show. They were not going to give me grey hair or make me look older. They told me how a lot of twists and turns were going to come in the story and that I was not their real father. What’s interesting about this character was that while he is an angry young man in front of everyone, he was a very chilled out and loud person in the company of his former wife. This is a man who will show his anger even when he is in a romantic mood.Taking a time leap is a common trend on Indian TV shows. If the makers take a time leap of 20 years, will you be ready to play a 50-60 year old on screen?I will be apprehensive but it completely depends on why and how they will justify the time leap. If I find it interesting, I will do it and if I won’t, I will step back.How do you bond with your team?We have a very good team, all of us are very good friends. We have a house party at one of the people’s houses on an off day. We bond like college friends when not working.You have also done a few films.My last film was Bezubaan Ishq in 2016. I do have plans to do films but I am committed for 25 days in a month for this show. As long as I am shooting for this one, I won’t be able to take out time for other things. But after that, I will pick up whatever interesting comes my way. It can be anything – a film, a web series or another TV show. Right now, all three platforms are doing so well that as an actor, there is a lot of scope for anyone to grow.What is the major difference between the television industry and Bollywood?In films, you have a bound script, you know the entire graph of the character and his journey from end to finish. In a television show, everything changes every week. The TRPs decide what works and what doesn’t work and what we are going to do with the story. If the character is not working, we change the character, if not the actor. As an actor, one has to be very flexible to adapt all the time. If the show goes on for a year, you have to come on the screen everyday but yet do something different to keep the audience hooked. I believe shooting a film is much easier than a TV show.",0

After a slump in tourism due to the killing of Hizbul Mujahideen commander Burhan Wani in July 2016, it took frequent spells of snow in January this year to bring large number of foreign tourists to Kashmir amid militancy.The good start to the tourist season of 2019 comes after the industry took a downturn in 2018, a year which witnessed military offensive. Over 8.5 lakh tourists including 50,000 foreigners visited the Valley in 2018 as compared to 11 lakh in 2017. Tourism director Nisar Wani said ,“We received 25,095 tourists across Kashmir in January this year, including 2,480 foreigners,” Wani said.The arrival of foreign tourists has seen a surge. The figure was 1,405 in 2016, 1,170 in 2017, 2,369 in 2018 and 2,480 in 2019. Domestic tourists in January 2018 were 49,000. Wani said domestic arrival was affected as national highway closed due to snowfall for 12 days in January. “The highway closure also increased the price of air tickets exponentially. However, we continue to see more tourists. On February 3, 2019, we saw the highest daily arrival of 1,400,” he added.A chance discovery for someTourists enjoy skiing and heli-skiing on the slopes of Gulmarg.Rob, 32, an Australian did not know that there was a place Gulmarg in India. He said he came to know about the ski resort by accident on internet as it was snowing in the area. “I was stunned when I reached here on January 22,” he said. Rob has decided to stay here for a month and do what he likes the most – snowboarding.“I first visited Manali and then stumbled upon this place. I am happy that I did. The experience here has been beyond my imagination. This is the best place for skiing and snowboarding,” said Rob.Rob, an Australian, loves snowboarding and said he discovered about Gulmarg by accident on Internet.

The last day for the ministry and the board to file its responses is May 18.Kumar’s lawyer Pankaj Sinha, himself visually challenged, submitted before a bench headed by Chief Justice Dipak Misra and Justice Sanjiv Khanna that “the differentiation was uncalled for.”The Railways justified the denial of e-ticketing facility, saying the electronic reservation slip could be misused by general public by making false claims of disability.But the court prima-facie found the argument untenable.

271,"Henkel goes vegan to revive beauty businessGerman consumer goods company Henkel announced new hair care formulations and brands on Thursday, seeking to tap into consumer demand for more natural ingredients as it tries to revive sluggish growth in its beauty business.Henkel will relaunch its European shampoo brand Schauma with a “vegan” formula, roll out to more markets its Nature Box line of hair and body care products made from cold-pressed oils and launch a new “free-from” hair dye line called OnlyLove.It will also launch a premium vegan brand for professional hair salons called Authentic Beauty Concept and expand its Pro Nature range of cleaning products to include detergents.The move comes as shoppers become more wary of processed chemical ingredients and seek out natural alternatives.Chief Executive Hans van Bylen told a news conference the products certified as vegan will initially address a niche market, but he sees strong potential and said the move will eventually help the company adjust all of its formulations.“The increasing shift towards a green lifestyle and the strong increase in the number of vegans has driven the growing demand for plant-derived ingredients in beauty products,” said Magda Starula, analyst at market data firm Euromonitor.The world’s biggest cosmetics manufacturer L’Oreal bought vegan beauty product firm Logocos Naturkosmetik last year and it has launched its own vegan range, Botanea, sourced from plants found in India.Unilever has also launched a fast-growing hair and body brand called Love Beauty and Planet, that is certified as vegan and cruelty-free.Henkel said the Schauma brand’s vegan formula will not contain silicones or parabens, while the Authentic Beauty Concept line will include “pure” ingredients.Henkel, the maker of Schwarzkopf shampoo and Persil detergent, made the announcement after warning in January that earnings would fall this year as it steps up investment in brands and digital technology to try to revive growth.The company has underperformed rivals like Procter & Gamble Co (P&G) and Unilever in recent years, with underlying sales in its beauty care business falling 0.7 percent in 2018 and the laundry unit growing just 1.9 percent.Henkel’s beauty care unit saw organic sales growth recover to 1 percent in the fourth quarter, but it still lagged behind adhesives and laundry, which grew 2.1 percent and 2.8 percent respectively in the period.Van Bylen said Henkel plans a global relaunch of its Persil brand, with new “four-chamber” detergent pods key to reviving growth in North America, where it is battling P&G for market share.",0
272,"High court admits plea against RPF personnelThe Bombay high court on Thursday admitted a public interest litigation (PIL) which sought a probe by Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) in an alleged scam run by Railway Police Force (RPF) of booking petty offenders in railway offences and then releasing them on fake bail bonds.Observing that prima facie offence was made out against RPF personnel, a division bench of justice BH Marlapalle and justice UD Salvi admitted the petition.The court has also issued notices to the Ministry of Railway and Ministry of Home, Government of India, asking them to file affidavit explaining their stand towards investigation against RPF officials.Public prosecutor Pandurang Pol submitted an affidavit filed by commissioner of police, Railways, which said that their “investigation revealed that offence was committed by RPF personnel on duty Thane Kurla in 2008-09 by using fake bail bonds and false documents and misappropriating the money collected from commuters after charging them with relevant sections under the Railways Act”.Pol also told the court that a special investigation team was formed to probe the alleged scam.The petition was filed by social activist Samir Zaveri alleging a scam relating to cash bonds issued by the RPF personnel at Kurla railway station in 2008-09.It claimed that certain RPF personnel were releasing persons booked for trespassing on fake cash bail bonds. They then asked the commuters to pay Rs 500 bail bonds each in fake courts staged by them. Track trespassing is an offence under section 147 of the Indian Railway Act.

273,"How an illiterate rickshaw-puller became a mascot for educationAhmed Ali from Assam’s Karimganj district, while pulling his cycle rickshaw one day in the late 1970s, felt miserable at the realization that like him his soon-to-be-born child too will remain illiterate.Ahmed Ali from Assam’s Karimganj district, while pulling his cycle rickshaw one day in the late 1970s, felt miserable at the realization that like him his soon-to-be-born child too will remain illiterate and may have to pull a rickshaw for a living.Hailing from Madhurband village, when Ali, now 82, moved to Karimganj town, about 300 km from Guwahati, he often saw children attending school and getting educated, and sometimes even ferried them to and from their homes to their schools in his rickshaw.The thought of his child not getting proper education hit him so hard that he decided he should do something about it so that poor children of the coming generation, including his own, do not suffer in privation like him.Since then, Ali has gone on to build nine schools and, because of his singular effort, he even found a mention in Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ‘Mann Ki Baat’ radio programme.“I feel it was Allah’s wish and blessings from locals that I could achieve whatever I wanted,” says a humble Ali.“I could not attend school due to poverty. People of my village were poor and it pained me to see the children there were not able to attend schools due to the same reason. I don’t want to see dropouts from poor families any more,” Ali told IANS during a function in Delhi where he was invited as a guest.For establishing the first school, he sold a portion of his land and donated another portion on which the building now stands. The funds for the schools were also arranged by him from his savings, daily earnings and some from charity.“There were some people in the area who supported the cause and helped in whatever way they could,” he said.To ensure there was no fund crisis for the school, he used to pull his rickshaw in the morning and cut wood at night. He sold that wood and used the money to build the school and later to run it.“There was not even a single school in the area. I had this very strong feeling that when my children will be born, they too will not have any school. After the birth of my first child (a boy), the feeling became more strong,” he said.The school, he added, was even more important for girls as “boys get a chance to go out and get an education, but girls do not”.With a firm resolve that he should do something about it, Ali met an education officer, whom he used to ferry in his rickshaw, and with his help, he established a middle school in his village in 1978.“Soon after it was established, I realised that first, we needed a primary school. Until children were educated at the primary level, who will get enrolled in middle school? In 1980, three-LP (Lower Primary) schools were opened,” he said.In all, Ali has opened three lower primary (class I-V) schools, five middle (class VI-VIII) schools and one high school in Madhurband and nearby villages.“Education is an important thing, and everyone should get a chance to get educated. It is a sin for anybody to not be educated,” he said.“Although I may be illiterate, I get respect from people. They now come to seek my blessings. I feel joy when I see that boys and girls from the village have been attending school. This joy inspired me and I never felt tired,” said Ali.“I get satisfaction when girls come and tell me how helpful these schools were for them. Every year, the overall number of girls in schools is higher than boys.”The high school, started in 1990, has 228 students in the current year. Every year, hundreds of students appear for the Class X exams, but they don’t have a place to study further.“I could only manage to make arrangements for students till Class X. They don’t have a place to study Class XI and XII. I need both the government’s approval and funds for setting up the higher-secondary school,” Ali said, in the hope that he will soon accomplish that as well.“There is no nearby college. The nearest college is also 15 km away. I also want to build a college for students, but that will come at a later stage. First we need a junior college (for students passing Class X),” he added.Ali came to limelight in March last year when Prime Minister Modi spoke about him in his monthly “Mann Ki Baat” address.Ali feels proud that the Prime Minister acknowledged his work and he desires to meet Modi.Asked what he will tell Modi, Ali said he wanted all that the schools should be government-recognised so that funds were never an issue. “I will also ask him for a junior college and a college, if possible.”",0
274,"How Kim Jong un went from pariah to guest of honorKim Jong Un’s arrival in Vietnam by train this week for a second meeting with US President Donald Trump may be most remarkable for how normal it’s becoming.Since opening talks with South Korea last year, the once-reclusive North Korean leader has turned into one of the most sought-after guests in Asia. At each stop -- from Beijing to Singapore and now Hanoi -- Kim, 35, is being escorted down red carpets by officials eager to build early ties with the head of one of the world’s last untapped emerging markets.The swing from international pariah to guest of honor is a testament to Kim’s success in wresting power from military chieftains and eliminating rivals since his father died in 2011. It also illustrates his long-held desire to restore an economy drained by decades of famine, state planning and military expansion under his father and grandfather.“If you want to really understand the Kim Jong Un of the present, you have to travel back to his early years,” said Kim Young-hui, who defected from North Korea in 2002 and is now a senior economist at the Korea Development Bank’s Inter-Korean Economic Cooperation Research Unit.He wondered why his father, Kim Jong Il, hadn’t traveled overseas much “and why North Korea was so poor,” she said, citing a book by a Japanese chef who worked for the late dictator. “Kim Jong Un was thinking that when he became the leader, he would run the country a lot better than his reclusive father.”Over the past seven years, the Swiss-educated Kim has steered North Korea from his father’s “military first” policy focused on building a nuclear arsenal to one that emphasizes the economy. After successfully testing an intercontinental ballistic missile in 2017, he declared the weapons program “complete,” initiated talks with Trump and announced a new strategy for boosting the economy.The move ended Trump’s threats of war and paved the way for a historic first meeting with the US president in June. It also opened a new world of potential investors from Seoul to Singapore -- provided Kim can get Trump to relax international sanctions against his weapons program.Trump played down expectations that he might quickly ease pressure on North Korea, telling US governors gathered at the White House on Sunday: “I’m not pushing for speed, but we’re not removing the sanctions.”In recent months, Kim has railed against the sanctions, which do everything from ban travel by officials to curb its energy imports. North Korea ranks as one of the world’s poorest countries and the sanctions are believed to have helped cause the country’s deepest recession in two decades in 2017, according to South Korean estimates.“When they come to negotiations, it means they are having a tough time internally due to sanctions and Kim feels nervous,” said Thae Yong-ho, who was North Korea’s deputy ambassador to the UK before defecting in 2016 and becoming a critic of the regime.Kim left Pyongyang on Saturday afternoon on a train that will take him through China down to Vietnam. He traveled abroad five times last year -- more than any North Korean leader in at least two decades -- often visiting industrial sites. Kim reportedly plans to do the same in Vietnam ahead of the planned summit, giving him a close-up view of a fellow socialist state that has prospered after easing hostility with the US.North Korean officials have been spotted near Samsung Electronics Co.’s smartphone plants in Vietnam, the Yonhap News Agency reported last week, suggesting Kim may tour South Korean factories. While South Korea is Vietnam’s second-largest trading partner, a North Korean leader hasn’t visited Vietnam since Kim’s grandfather, Kim Il Sung, in 1964.Trump himself has repeatedly cited Kim’s development goals while arguing why North Korea would trade its nuclear arsenal away.“Chairman Kim realizes, perhaps better than anyone else, that without nuclear weapons, his country could fast become one of the great economic powers anywhere in the World,” Trump tweeted on Sunday. “Because of its location and people (and him), it has more potential for rapid growth than any other nation!”Kim hasn’t secured his control over North Korea by showing weakness. His reign has been marked by ruthless purges and executions, including the killing of his uncle and one-time deputy, Jang Song Thaek, as well as the murder of his older half-brother, Kim Jong Nam.That consolidation of power has given him the space to introduce economic and government reforms once seen as nearly impossible in the insular, one-party state. And it’s allowed him to shake hands with Trump, the leader of a country that North Korean propaganda has spent generations blaming for all of its problems.Even now, the purges appear to be continuing. Kim exiled, imprisoned or executed 50 to 70 members of the country’s political elite last year, including opponents of engagement with the US, according to a report published last week by the North Korea Strategy Center, a Seoul-based research institution founded by a former defector.“Kim Jong Un has been very skillful in rewarding the friendly, co-opting the neutral and punishing the hostile,” said Moon Chung-in, special adviser on foreign policy to South Korean President Moon Jae-in, said in an interview earlier this month. “His longevity is institutionally guaranteed. But at the same time he’s good at consolidating power.”Kim now needs to show the elite back in Pyongyang that his engagement efforts can bring economic opportunity without sacrificing the country’s nuclear deterrent -- its “treasured sword.” The regime has a long history of coming to the bargaining table dangling the prospect of cooperation, only to renege on deals after extracting economic concessions.Chun Yungwoo, former chief South Korean envoy to international nuclear negotiations with North Korea, said Kim’s successful consolidation of power requires him to consider what kind of country he wants to rule over for the next 40 to 50 years.“He wants to have a more prosperous country -- he wants economic development,” Chun said. “Without giving up nuclear weapons, all he can do is maintain a subsistence-level economy.”",0
275,"How railways put men at 11 level crossings a day Indian railways did away with at least 11 of its thousands of unmanned level crossings every day during the past 10 months to eliminate these death traps. The last such crossing on broad-gauge lines was converted into a gated one in Allahabad on Thursday, the same day railway minister Piyush Goyal confirmed in his budget speech that these unmanned crossings were a thing of the past. According to railway ministry officials, an accident on April 16, 2018 involving a school van at such a crossing on Kaptanganj-Thawe section in UP that claimed 13 lives was the turning point for putting the focus on quickly doing away with these crossings. “The ministry had told the Parliament these crossings would be a thing of past by March 2020. But work on a war footing was undertaken to complete the task earlier after the accident,” said an official. The number of accidents at unmanned level crossings has been at an all-time low at only three during this fiscal as compared to 65 in 2009-10. Sources said in most of the cases either mechanised or manual system of operating gates have been operationalised to stop vehicles from crossing the tracks when trains go past these spots. They added at some crossing, they have route relay interlocking system where the rail traffic flow is highe Officials said the railways had zeroed down on four models to eliminate the crossings including merger with another level crossing by constructing diversion road, construction of subway or rail under bridge and manning. The last option was found to be most cost effective and less time taking. Building rail under and over bridges often require land acquisition and other permissions.",1
276,"Huawei says Mate X’s India launch depends on 5G availability, no plans for 4G?variantPowered by the company’s Kirin 980 processor, the Huawei Mate X comes with a 6.6-inch dual display panel and offers a FullView display.Dashing hopes of Indian consumers willing to acquire the just-released foldable phone from Huawei any time soon, the company says it is not planning to bring a 4G version of the Mate X shortly and that its availability will depend on the 5G network in the country.Although India is targeting 2020 for 5G roll-out, the country is yet to allocate 5G spectrum to operators even for 5G trial of use cases.Expensive at 2,299 euros (about Rs 1,85,000), the foldable Mate X is a 5G phone and as the US has been raising security concerns over use of Huawei 5G equipment, the European market could be the first to see the release of the phone.Huawei showcased the foldable phone at Mobile World Congress (MWC), Barcelona, on Sunday, but did not allow the visiting journalists to touch the device.“We expect to start shipping the device form the middle of this year through the carrier channel. Making the device available in the open market may take some time,” Kevin Ho, President of the Handset Business, Huawei Consumer Business Group, told IANS here.Replying to a question about producing foldable phone for the 4G network, he said that although the company was not focusing on bringing a 4G to suit markets like India, it could consider such a proposal at a later stage.Powered by the company’s Kirin 980 processor, the Huawei Mate X comes with a 6.6-inch dual display panel and offers a FullView display.It houses massive 4,500 mAH dual battery and several industry-first features, including a new superfast charging capability that can reach 85 per cent battery in just 30 minutes.The phone features a flexible OLED panel and a falcon wing mechanical hinge.“Creating the foldable phone’s hinge is the most challenging part for our engineers,” Ho said. “We had to design the hinge to avoid layers like formation that one gets when one folds a book or a notebook. This was a big challenge and they had to use a sophisticated technology,” he added.While Ho asserted that the phone was ready for mass production, he acknowledged that the company was still doing several tests and was also in talks with app developers so that apps can be optimised for a foldable device.The 8GB + 512 GB phone, which can be easily unfolded at the click of a button, now has only one colour, Interstellar Blue, and comes with a full protection case. Huawei said it might introduce new colours for the device at a later stage.When unfolded, the 6.6-inch dual display panel transforms into an 8-inch tablet only 5.4mm thick.While unveiling the device on Sunday at a packed hall here, Huawei Consumer Business Group CEO Richard Yu claimed that the phone offers best selfie camera. But the company did not reveal the camera specifications.“The phone will provide users more privacy and security protection,” he said.“Today, many carriers are using NSA (non-standalone) architecture, working together with 4G. But the future of 5G is SA (standalone) architecture.“Mate X is the only phone now with the capability to work in both the architecture. So this phone is not only for today, but also for future 5G,” Yu noted.Ho parried questions on security concerns raised by countries like the US which accuse Huawei of passing on data to the Chinese government.“We don’t want to talk about it today. We want to focus on technology and our new products today,” he said.",0

No casualty was reported.The crash happened barely 15 minutes after it took off from Gorakhpur air base along with two other Jaguars for routine exercise.Panic-stricked locals rushed to the site of the burning wreckage in large numbers, Kushinagar district magistrate Anil Kumar said.An eyewitness said they saw the aircraft explode in flames in the sky before hitting the ground with a bang while the pilot landed in a sandy area close to the river bed.“Two other such planes continued to hover in sky when the aircraft crashed. The strong winds intensified the flames of the burning plane and soon it was reduced to ashes,” said another eyewitness.On being informed by locals, police and administration officials, including DM Kumar and senior superintendent of police (SSP) Rajeev Mishra, rushed to the accident site with rescue teams and fire tenders, while an air force chopper airlifted the injured pilot to Gorakhpur airbase where he was admitted for treatment of minor injuries on his back.While the cause of the crash is not known, a court of inquiry has been ordered by Gorakhpur air force officials.Speaking on phone, wing commander Prayagraj air force station, Arvind Sinha, said: “An inquiry has been ordered to look in to the reason of the mishap.”The district magistrate said “the pilot showed courage and presence of mind by diverting the plane away from populated area towards the Chhoti Gandak river but it crashed midway in a field after catching fire. He saved his life by jumping off the plane when it was just about 150 metres from the crash site. He is fine and undergoing treatment at Gorakhpur air force hospital”.",0

279,"Illegal shrines derail centre’s multi-modal terminal project in VaranasiThe National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government’s plan to set up a so-called multi-modal terminal which provides rail, road and waterways connectivity in Varanasi , Uttar Pradesh has run into trouble because of places of worship that have been illegally constructed on the land meant for the project.“Land has been an issue in this project. There are certain sensitivities; there are three mosques and four temples on the railway land on which we want to build the terminal,” a senior official at the ministry of road transport said requesting anonymity. This person added that the ministry doesn’t want to push things on this front because demolishing places of worship could become a contentious issue ahead of the next year’s parliamentary polls.The proposed terminal at Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s constituency is part of the Jal Marg Vikas Project (JMVP, a Rs 5,369 crore World Bank aided project on the Ganga, aimed at augmenting the navigational capacity of the Varanasi to Haldia stretch of the river, to enable commercial navigation of at least 1500-2000 ton vessels).The land in question belongs to the Railways which leased it out to National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) for construction of a bus and a railway terminal.“This is railways’ land and has been given to the NHAI on an ‘as is where is’ basis and they were to further develop that land. The issue is that on some of the land there are mosques and temples. They are unable to find a way to remove them. So i don’t think that project will be able to go forward,” a senior official at ministry of railway said on condition for anonymity.The government had awarded the contract to AFCONS Infrastructure for the construction of phase I of the Multi-Modal Terminal at Varanasi for Rs 170 crore.“ Railways land is usually very old, this one must be around 150 years old hence we don’t know when or how these structures were built they assume that they have been built in the last 20 years. The land is around 100 acres big. We had handed over the rights of the land to NHAI about two months ago,” the railways official said.The Detailed Project Report (DPR) of the construction of the project was prepared by NHAI. It involved building a multi-modal terminal including a railway station and a bus terminal. The land is situated at Kashi station in Varanasi. “There is no easy solution to such sensitive issues. The basic issue is that before construction has to happen it is important to remove these places of worship. NHAI has asked the civil administration to look into it but they also have their own compulsion since this happens to be a sensitive religious issue,” the railway ministry official added.The project has been caught up in land related issues since its inception. Another piece of land near the proposed water terminal couldn’t be acquired initially.“We had some issues which were finally sorted out. There was a group of ‘Hindu Mahants’ who had ownership of the land and they argued that they would not vacate this till the government gave them another plot in the same area, which also was disputed. Officials and state had to get involved to resolve it,” a senior official at the ministry of shipping said.Union minister for road transport, highways and shipping Nitin Gadkari laid the foundation stone for the terminal at Varanasi in August, 2016. The ministry is now considering changing its plans. “There are many land related issues in this project. There was also a small patch of land which was allotted and leased to some trust and now the trust claims to own the land. There are issues with some religious structures. So we are looking at whether it is feasible to overcome this or adjust the entire layout of the multi-modal hub, “ the road ministry official said.Under JMVP, three multi-modal terminals are being constructed at Varanasi, Sahibganj and Haldia. The total financial progress for the project at the end of 2017-18 was ~678.85 crore or 13.05%. JMVP is scheduled to be completed by December, 2022.According to officials at the ministry of shipping and the IWAI, the government is keen to get the water terminal inaugurated by PM in November. According to IWAI, nearly 85% of the work has been completed for the water terminal. The agency added that all issues related to land have been addressed. “The project construction is going on schedule without any hindrances,” IWAI said.",1

281,"In Gorakhpur rally, PM Modi set the tone for Lok Sabha poll battle in PurvanchalPrime Minister Narendra Modi has set the pitch for a fierce poll battle in Purvanchal region (east UP) with the announcement of the launch of Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN) as well as Rs 10,000-crore development projects for the region on Sunday.Aware of the importance of 31 Lok Sabha seats of east UP that will be crucial in regaining power at the Centre, Modi said the NDA government had launched several development and welfare schemes to give thrust to development in the region.“The projects will pave way for development of Purvanchal that remained neglected under the Congress, Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) and the Samajwadi Party (SP) governments,” he said.The prestige of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) will be at stake as its top leaders, including PM Narendra Modi, Kalraj Mishra, Manoj Sinha, Varun Gandhi, Mahendra Nath Pandey and UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath come from this region.In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the BJP had swept this region by grabbing all the seats except Azamgarh that went into the SP’s kitty. The Congress won two while the BSP failed to open its account.As the BJP plans to bag maximum seats from the region, various development and welfare schemes have been announced during public meetings in PM’s Lok Sabha constituency Varanasi, located on the southern tip of Purvanchal, and Gorakhpur that is located in the north.With the SP-BSP combine and the Congress also shifting their focus on Purvanchal, the BJP is going all out to win maximum support from the region.The SP-BSP alliance has shared equal number of seats in Purvanchal to give a tough fight to BJP.Once a strong fort of alliance partners, the BJP made inroads into their vote base in the 2014 Lok Sabha election.SP leader Shivram Yadav said, “Riding on Dalit-Backwards-Muslim formula, the alliance hopes to check the BJP.”The Congress has appointed Priyanka Gandhi Vadra as its general secretary for east UP. The region had played a major role in the formation of UPA government in 2004 and 2009 Lok Sabha elections.In 2014, Congress was wiped out in Purvanchal which was its stronghold since Independence.Congress has also appointed three secretaries – Zubair Khan, Kumar Ashish and Bajirao Khade – to assist Priyanka in the battle of ballot. The party plans to win over upper castes, Dalits and Muslims that were its traditional vote base.That the BJP is concerned over the SP-BSP alliance as well as Congress’s Purvanchal plan can be gauged from the fact that during their address both the PM as well as the CM highlighted the government’s development schemes and attacked the opposition parties.Modi said the BJP government strengthened health facilities in the region, restarted fertiliser factory, electrified rail routes, started manufacturing of railway engine in Varanasi and Gorakhpur to pave way for prosperity in the area.Political analyst AK Mishra said, “To retain the BJP’s hold on Purvanchal region, Modi launched PM-KISAN Scheme in Gorakhpur. Purvanchal region is the agriculture hub of the state and the support of farmers will play a decisive role in elections. The SP-BSP alliance is working on caste equations to win the election while Congress is depending on the magic of Priyanka Gandhi. Besides YogiModi charisma, BJP is playing Purvanchal development card to win the election.”",0
282,"In the next 3-4 years, all trains will run fast and on time’Manish Anand , said that his ministry would soon move the Union Cabinet for approval of “government-to-government” partnerships with foreign countries, a step beyond the concept of foreign direct investment.We saw big-ticket FDI investment in the railway workshop projects at Madhepura and Mahraura in Bihar to the tune of Rs 40,000 crore. What would be the next big FDI investment in the railways We have seen massive interest from a number of countries in the modernisation of our railway stations. South Korea has already submitted its model of redevelopment of the New Delhi railway station. South Korea is ready with a proposal to invest as much as Rs 8,000 crore in the modernisation of the New Delhi railway station. The model is with us, which will be a complete gamechanger as far as a railway station is seen. France is keen to redevelop the Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus in Mumbai. The French are also working for the re-development of Ludhiana station. In the coming times, we will see major FDI inflow into the railway sector.You have been to Germany, France, Japan and many other countries. The railways appear to have become India’s engagement with foreign countries. What can we expect from these countries in the railways We are soon going to the Union Cabinet for approval to enter into “government-to-government” (G-G) investment (agreements). We are ready to sign agreements with as many as 14 countries. They are ready to partner with Indian Railways to make their governments partners in the progress of the railways. Among the 14 countries are Japan, China, Germany, Czechoslovakia, South Korea, France and the United Arab Emirates. G-G investment is better than FDI for the railways because here we do not have to worry about the involvement of private players. The money will come from the government of the partner country. In the coming years, we are going to witness massive G-G investment in the railways. Japan alone is going to invest close to $25 billion in Indian Railways, besides the bullet train project.After commissioning the semi-high-speed rail between New Delhi and Agra, what progress can we expect on speeding up the railways We are going to offer one semi-high-speed route each to the 14 countries with which we are soon going to operationalise the G-G investment model. These countries will build the infrastructure and Indian Railways will integrate them into the existing system. Thus, we can have a large number of semi-high-speed rail networks getting commissioned at the same time; this can change the very face of the railways and the country in the next four to five years.We already are holding trials of the Spanish semi-high-speed Talgo trains. It’s a matter of a few weeks in which we will know the full details of the claims being made by Talgo. Once we get the details, we will take the next course of action.The Bibek Debroy Committee on the restructuring of the Railway Board was constituted soon after the Narendra Modi government came to power. Many more committees have in the past submitted reports. What is being done about their reports So far we have already implemented almost 90 per cent of the recommendations of the Bibek Debroy Committee. We have constituted two cross-functional directorates for non-tariff revenue and mobility, which will directly report to the chairman, Railway Board. We have already delegated powers to the general managers and divisional railway managers. Soon we will sign a memorandum of understanding with the zonal railways in which we will ensure their functional autonomy. Thus, much of the desired outcomes of the various committees have been implemented so far, and much more will be done. Very soon we are also going to establish the rail tariff authority. We are currently examining the legislative and non-legislative components of the proposed authority.In the beginning of the coming to power of the Modi government, we heard much talk about the lateral entry of professionals in government departments. Is the idea still alive We are soon going to induct 100 interns from outside the railways who would become part of the organisation. We are keen to take outside professionals, and the cross-functional directorates would look to benefit from their talent pool.With a soft loan from Japan in place for the bullet train project between Ahmedabad and Mumbai, the popular perception persists that such investment should have come in for existing railway infrastructure. There is a place for a five-star hotel in an economy and similarly a bullet train project too is important for the country. In our economy we have five-star hotels where we do not expect the common man to go. We are not going to invest anything in the bullet train project. The money is coming from Japan. But we will gain from the induction of technology, the safety standards, the capacity to execute big-ticket projects, besides the huge spin-off effect on the economy by spending such a huge sum of money in the country.When are we going to see the fruits of the investment being made in capacity augmentation by the railways, which has been the priority of your two projects In the last financial year we commissioned 2,828 km of new lines, broad gauge conversion and doubling. In the next two years we will add almost 7,000 km of such lines. We are going to invest close to Rs 45,000 crore in the next two years for such projects. By 2019, we hope to commission the twin dedicated freight corridors between Dadri and JNPT, Mumbai and Ludhiana-Kolkata. With their commissioning, much of the tracks will be available for running of trains and will also allow us to time-table the goods trains. In the next three to four years trains will not only run on time, but fast and tickets would also be available on demand",1

286,"Indian Railways And Facilities Provided To The PublicIn the entire world, Indian railways has gained the position of being the largest public system of passengers transport. About 7500 trains for passengers are run by Indian railways carrying 12 million people on an average every day. The first train was run in 1853 from Mumbai’s Victoria Terminals to Thane. A British engineer Robert Maitland Brereton was responsible for the expansion of railways from the year 1857 onwards. Indian Railways is world’s seventh largest utility employer with over 1,376 million employees. As for rolling stock Indian Railways holds over 2,45,267 freights wagons, 66,392 passenger coaches and 10,499 locomotives and runs 12,617 passenger trains and 7421 freight trains daily. Indian Railways earn about 70 per cent of its revenues from freight traffic so majority of its profits come from freight and this makes up for losses on passengers fares low it cross-subsidises the loss making passenger traffic with the profit making freight traffic. However its share in freight traffic is much lower than road traffic. This should be looked into and rational approach for fixing fares for goods trains and passenger trains. Railways has two UNESCO world heritage sites namely the Chatrapari Shivaji Terminus and the mountain railways of India. But, this huge organisation is running in losses of Rs. 30, 000 crores in the passenger segment for the year ending March 2014. As in the practise of railway ministry, new railway line projects are announced during the railway budget each year, without securing additional funding for them. In the last 12 years 99 new line projects worth Rs. 60,000 crores were announced out of which only one project is complete till date while four projects that are as old as 30 years, but are still not complete. This practise of announcing new railway line projects needs a serious approach and should not be announced without proper sanction of budget is there. The passenger facilities like waiting rooms and retiring rooms, needs a serious and practical approach. The passenger associations and railway employees must be consulted on regular basis. Often there are no proper electricity connections for charging mobile phones and they are over crowded. Most of the major railway stations have these waiting rooms, but one cannot be sure of their presence in all stations across India. Retiring rooms are there in larger and important railway stations. Retiring rooms can be basic rooms or dormitory or suits. But these retiring or waiting rooms lack recommended amenities. The railway ministry must pay attention to them rather than to announce new railway line, which may not come without provision of funding.",1

A release from ISMA said: ""As on 15th February, 2019, 507 sugarNSE 14.71 % mills in the country have produced 219.30 lakh tonnes of sugar, as compared to 203.55 lakh tonnes produced by 494 mills on the corresponding date last year. Higher production this year is mainly because Maharashtra and Karnataka sugar mills started their crushing earlier this year. Overall, the country is expected to produce less sugar this season as compared to last season."" According to ISMA, in Maharashtra, sugar production till 15th February 2019 was 82.98 lakh tonnes, compared with 74.74 lakh tonnes produced last year same period. In the current 2018-19 SS, 6 mills have closed their crushing operations in the State while 187 sugar mills are operating, as against 183 mills operated last year on the corresponding date. Due to early start of mills in Maharashtra, the mills therein are expected to close earlier than last year, especially when the sugar production from Maharashtra will be less than last year. In U.P. 117 sugar mills are in operation and they have produced 63.93 lakh tonnes of sugar till 15th February 2019, compared with 64.54 lakh tonnes produced by 119 mills on the corresponding date of last year. The sugar recovery achieved this season is about 0.77% more than what was achieved so far during the last season, but the yield per hectare is lower than last year, because of which the total production in U.P. will be less than last year.In case of Karnataka, till 15th February, 2019, mills have produced 38.74 lakh tonnes of sugar, 10 mills have closed their operations in the State while 57 mills are in operation. During the corresponding period last year, 52 mills had produced 30.73 lakh tonnes sugar. In case of Tamil Nadu, 33 sugar mills are in operation and have produced 3.50 lakh tonnes of sugar, as compared to 2.90 lakh tonnes produced by 28 sugar mills in 2017-18 SS on the corresponding date. Gujarat has produced 7.78 lakh tonnes of sugar till 15th February 2019 with 16 sugar mills in operation. Last year, 17 sugar mills were in operation and they had produced 7.25 lakh tonnes of sugar on the same date. In Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, 24 sugar mills have produced 4.50 lakh tonnes as on 15th February 2019, as compared to 4.60 lakh tonnes produced by 23 sugar mills on the corresponding date last season. In Bihar, Uttarakhand, Punjab, Haryana and Madhya Pradesh & Chhattisgarh, sugar production till 15th February 2019 has been in the order of 4.90 lakh tonnes,2.15 lakh tonnes, 3.75 lakh tonnes, 3.60 lakh tonnes and 3.20 lakh tonnes, respectively.

At least 200 have been injured.Sources said the probe team was also looking into allegations that the two loco pilots — Janak Sharma and Pramesh Purohit — were drunk at the time of the accident. Sharma, Purohit and train guard Ajay Srivastava appeared before the inquiry panel headed by rail safety (eastern railways) commissioner PK Acharya on Tuesday to record their statements. “Blood samples of the pilots were taken and sent for medical examination. The report hasn’t come yet,” said Acharya.The panel summoned 41 railway employees of different departments in Jhansi railway division for their written statement. Some people, mostly passengers, also came to record their statements.The panel will record statements of people and railway personnel for two days but the period can be extended. The inquiry report will be submitted within a month to the Railways ministry.Railway men mostly stuck to the version that there was no problem with the train. Gate man Ravindra Paswan, who was at gate no 197 at the time of the mishap, said in his deposition before the panel that the train was moving at normal speed and there was no issue with it.However, Ishwar Dass, another railway employee, said when the train passed his point at 3.01am, it left the overhead wires dangling, indicating that it was running at high speed.

290,"International Conference On Decarbonization Of Indian Railways- Mission Electrification Begins TodayMinistry of Railways through Institution of Railways Electrical Engineer (IREE) in partnership with ASSOCHAM India is organising the International Conference on Decarbonization of Indian Railways- Mission Electrification today. Member Traction, Railway Board Ashwani Kumar Kapoor briefed about this conference and gave following information:-An International Conference on “Decarbonization of Indian Railways – Mission Electrification” is being organized in New Delhi on 3rd Nov.’16.The Conference aims at bringing various stakeholders on a common platform for exchange of ideas and to deliberate on implementable technological solutions and financing options to significantly increase pace of electrification and achieve the target for setting up of renewable energy installations with total capacity of 1000MW by 2020.The Conference will also project Indian Railways as an attractive investment destination considering its plans for huge investment in next 5 years towards modernization of its electrified network and use of renewable energy.The Conference shall cover aspects relating to policy, technological modernization, mechanization, innovations and financing models for railway electrification and de-carbonization. National Transport Development Policy Committee (NTDPC), in its report, has identified electrification of railway tracks as a means to reduce fuel consumption. The report has recommended for taking up electrification on priority through systematically tackling the bottlenecks in progress of electrification projects. It has also suggested that electrification should be viewed as a means of making rail transport independent of imported fossil energy, while also provide a choice in sourcing energy. Moreover, electric traction allows regeneration of power while braking/coasting and feeding the network, thereby reducing overall consumption of energy and carbon emissions. In this regard, following action has been planned for improving efficiency and bringing in cost economies in freight and passenger operations. Reducing the Carbon Foot prints through use of sustainable and green sources of energy is also a key focus area.In line with this vision, following action plan has been planned: Electrification of Railway TracksCurrently 28,000 rkm of tracks are electrified (42% of the total network) carrying around two-thirds of total freight traffic and 50% of total passenger traffic. As against 800 kms of average electrification in the earlier years, 1600 rkm of railway tracks were electrified in 2015-16. To fast track the pace of electrification, Ministry of Railway would be involving PSUs like IRCON, RITES and PGCIL. Increase in the pace of electrification will reduce its fuel bill by Rs. 10,000 cr. annually as against the business as usual approach. Harnessing Renewable Energy on IR to reduce energy cost and carbon footprints Indian Railways targets to harness 1 GW solar and 500 MW wind power as announced in Rail Budget 2015-’16, 500 MW of solar units on roof tops through Central Finance Assistance (CFA) from MNRE and balance 500 MW on land.",1

292,"Is it curtains for Congress' Bansal?One could hear a pin drop at former railway minister and Congress candidate Pawan Bansal's residence at Sector 28 on Friday afternoon, as it became clear that the Chandigarh MP for the last three times in a row will lose the seat. As it later transpired, he lost by 69,642 votes, the highest-ever for the city, polling 1,21, 720 votes.The day started as usual for him as he rose even before sunrise, at around 5:30am. A quick shower and prayer followed by a cup of tea was what it took for him to be ready to accept the people's verdict, and as the day wore on, he looked increasingly downcast. The handful of supporters that had gathered before counting began also dwindled away as the trends that showed him trailing trickled in.So, as Bansal with wife Madhu visited the counting centre at around 9:30am and was back in half an hour, the writing was on the wall and the deserted Congress office in Sector 35 said it all.It is clear that the Railgate, the infighting within the party, the anti-incumbency against the UPA, the nation-wide Modi wave and the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) factors combined led to the defeat of the four-time parliamentarian.With the Congress suffering a humiliating defeat across the country and Bansal losing, in what was his bastion, is it curtains on the political career of the veteran political leader?Bansal, who had held important positions in the UPA-1 and UPA-11 including the parliamentary affairs ministry and the railway ministry, will be without any work now as HT brings you the reasons for the loss.Less than expected votes from coloniesAs more than half of the 6.13 lakh voters were from colonies and villages and the turnout here had always been high, Bansal had expected a sizeable number of votes. He probably failed to hold ground here against the Modi wave. The BJP's focus on highlighting the Railgate, where his nephew was caught by the CBI accepting `90 lakh for a posting, when he was the railway minister, probably influenced the voters. AAP candidate Gul Panag also took away some of these votes.",1

296,"Kangana Ranaut attacks Manikarnika co-director Krish after NTR biopic’s failure, says time to question ‘every vulture’Kangana Ranaut has criticised Manikarnika co-director Krrish as his NTR biopic failed to perform at the box office, saying ‘now is the time to question every vulture who was out for my blood’.Actor Kangana Ranaut has constantly been in headlines for her film Manikarnika: The Queen of Jhansi which eventually entered the Rs 100 crore club at the domestic box office. Earlier, co-director Krish had accused the actor of hijacking the film and a bitter exchange of words had followed the film’s release. Krish had reportedly left Manikarnika to direct the NTR biopic titled NTR Mahanayakudu, which failed at the box office.This has now given the actor one more reason to criticise the filmmaker. On being asked about the same, Kangana told Pinkvilla, “Yes, I also read about zero recovery of NTR, it’s called black mark on the actor’s career. My heart goes out to Balakrishna sir who trusted Krish and put so much at stake, but for me now is the time to question every vulture who was out for my blood, who attacked and harassed me for taking charge of a troubled situation and making a critically acclaimed and commercially successful film (Manikarnika), but what is shameful is that Krish and some paid media ran a sabotage campaign against a martyr’s biopic. Honestly, I am embarrassed of them, our freedom fighters gave blood for some thankless fools.”The actor was part of several controversies and had accused Bollywood celebrities of not supporting her during the film’s release. It seems she has finally found support in senior actors including Anupam Kher and Paresh Rawal who have slammed people on social media for making fun of a behind-the-scene video featuring Kangana on a mechanical horse during the shooting of battle scenes for Manikarnika.While her sister Rangoli had spoken up in her defence and justified how an actor’s close-up is shot just like all Bollywood and Hollywood films, now Paresh Rawal and Anupam Kher have come out in her support.Paresh Rawal took to Twitter to justify Rangoli’s stand and sharing how scenes are shot with the help of special effects. He tweeted, “According to these dimwits and pinheads they believe that superman and Batman in Hollywood films are actually flying and it’s not some camera trick or CG effects ...!”Anupam had earlier called out a user for criticising Kangana for not using a real horse to shoot some battle scenes. He had tweeted, “How much venom this man has against a self made actress #KanganaRanaut!! This is called ‘acting’ idiot. Actors all over the world do that. That is their job. She will be remembered for decades for her hard work in movies. While you got your fifteen minute fame by using her name.”Earlier, co-director Krish had accused the actor of hijacking the film and a bitter exchange of words had followed the film’s release. Kangana had earlier called out Alia Bhatt and Aamir Khan for not supporting her films, claiming she always does the same for others. Kangana said while she attended the screenings of Dangal, Secret Superstar and Raazi, Alia and Aamir did not return the favour.According to a report in Pinkvilla, Kangana said she made a phonecall to Alia and told her to ‘grow a spine’. She said, “I suggested that she (Alia) grows some spine and support an important film about woman empowerment and nationalism....if she doesn’t have a voice of her own and her existence is all about being KJo (Karan Johar) puppet then I don’t consider her successful... I told her if she is only focusing on earning bucks and not raise a voice, then her success has no value.... hope she understands the true meaning of success and her responsibilities, Napo gang life is simply restricted to give and take favours hope she rises above that.”",0

The excluded professionals include doctors, engineers, lawyers, chartered accountants and architects registered with professional bodies, the agriculture ministry said in the operational guidelines for the Pradhan Mantri KIsan SAmman Nidhi (PM-KISAN) scheme announced in the interim budget on February 1. The government will not cover those with a monthly pension of Rs 10,000 or more. The scheme promises to pay Rs 6,000 a year in three instalments to farmers who own up to 2 hectares of land, with the first instalment due for the period from December 1 to March 31. States have been given a deadline of February 25 to submit lists of eligible farmers. The cut-off date for eligible farmers is February 1 of this year, after which new owners of agricultural land won’t be considered for the next five years. “However, benefit will be allowed in those cases where transfer of ownership of cultivable land takes place on account of succession due to death of the landowner,” according to a document on the website of the Department of Agriculture Cooperation & Farmers Welfare. An alternative mechanism will be set up for the northeast, where land ownership is often community based, making it difficult to select eligible famers. The mechanism for eligibility of northeast farmers will be developed and approved by a committee of Union ministers from the Ministry of Development of North East Region (DoNER), Ministry of Land Resources, Agriculture Minister and the state chief ministers or their ministerial representative, based on the proposal by the northeast states concerned. The Centre has asked the states to identify and designate a sponsoring bank for this scheme. “States may consider designating the same bank being used for transfer of fund for MNRGES as sponsoring bank for this scheme,” it said. It said the designated bank should have well-developed IT systems with the capabilities of integration with the web portal of the scheme and Public FinancialManagement System (PFMS).",0

Sharma counts himself as one of them.“The Trans bill is the single biggest mistake of the [ruling] BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party],” he said. “If it is passed, it will make life very difficult for us.” The bill, however, was not taken up by the Rajya Sabha during the final session of Parliament.Sharma, who identifies as a transman, cannot get a voter ID card made, because, in a conundrum that is peculiar to the transgender community, he does not have “proof” of his gender identity. The two identifying documents that he possesses, the Aadhaar card and PAN (Permanent Account Number) card, are in the female gender he was assigned at birth. “I am not making a voter ID card right now because I know that it will be difficult to change the gender and name on it. First I’ll get my Aadhaar and PAN card corrected, and then I’ll get all these made.” Does he know what needs to be done? “Yes, main aapko batata hoon (let me tell you about it),” he said, narrating the procedure. When will he do it? Soon, he replies.",0
303,"Lok Sabha elections 2019: BJP to go it alone in HaryanaThe Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) would go it alone in Haryana in the forthcoming Lok Sabha elections, party’s co-incharge for parliamentary polls in the state, Vishwas Sarang, said.Sarang, who was in Kurukshetra on Saturday to attend a workshop of party workers from Kurukshetra, Karnal, Ambala and Sonepat Lok Sabha constituencies, said the decision about party candidates would be taken by the party’s central leadership after discussion with state leaders.Exuding confidence that the BJP would win all the 10 Lok Sabha seats in Haryana, Sarang said the results of Jind assembly byelection had proved that opposition parties, especially the Congress, had lost ground in the state.He, however, parried question on why the BJP had not taken action against Kurukshetra MP Raj Kumar Saini, who has formed a separate party.Earlier, addressing party workers in the Kurukshetra University’s auditorium, chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar said Prime Minister Narendra Modi will address 11 crore party workers in the country on February 28. BJP’S national president Amit Shah would hold a meeting of party workers at Hisar on February 25 and on March 2, a bike rally would be taken out in every assembly constituency of the state, he said.Without taking any name, Khattar alleged that many Congress leaders were facing corruption cases. “Leaders alone cannot be blamed for corruption. Government officers and employees also play an equal role,” he added.“But we have managed to eliminate corruption, ”the CM said.Khattar and BJP’S Haryana in-charge Anil Jain also launched a mobile app of ‘Digital BJP Haryana’ on the occasion.",0
304,"Maha-­Metro faces land acquisition hurdles in old Pune or ‘peth’ areasMaharashtra Metro Rail Corporation Ltd (Maha-Metro) is facing opposition from residents in the old Pune or ‘peth’ areas for acquiring land for construction of Metro stations at Budhwar peth and Mandai.Maha-Metro had already identified 322 entities whose properties will need to be acquired in these areas for carrying out the construction work. Brijesh Dixit, managing director, Maha-Metro said, “It is natural to face opposition for land acquisition. No one is willing to give their property. However, the government needs to acquire the lands to complete the projects in the larger interest.”Dixit said there are 205 Metros working in the world and all of them face similar problems when it comes to land acquisition. However, Maha-Metro is planning to give “good compensation” to the project affected people and is keeping all options open such as giving cash component or alternate property at another location, and TDR (transfer of development rights) for handing over the properties.“This is a crowed area and Maha-Metro will need these properties for erecting the metro stations. The metro corridors will not need land acquisition,” he said.The affected properties have been surveyed by Maha-Metro with the help of third party as well its project officials. The authorities have also assured to rehabilitate the affected people in the same locality. PMC has one plot in the city area which can be developed and all the affected families can be rehabilitated in the same locality, he said.Dixit said Maha Metro will ensure that no injustice would be done to anyone during the land acquisition process.Railway ministry gives approvalAfter defence ministry, the railway ministry has given its approval for crossings over railway lines on the Pune Metro route and connectivity with Khadki, Shivajinagar and Pune stations.Brijesh Dixit, managing director, maharashtra metro rail corporation said, “Pune is lucky as it is getting speedy permissions for the Metro project. After the defence ministry’s recent nod to hand over 10 acres land at Khadki, Dapodi and Range Hills, the railway ministry has given its approval for crossing the railway lines near Kamgar Putala and connecting of metro stations with railway stations at Khadki, Shivajinagar and Pune Railway station.The defence ministry has cleared the Pune Metro right of way permission as also the land transfer proposal for Metro stations,” he said.The Maha Metro’s Pimpri-Chinchwad to Swargate Metro corridor is passing from the Khadki Cantonment area for which defence land is required for parking and construction of railway stations at Khadki, Dapodi and at Range Hills. Land is also required from the defence ministry for erecting the metro corridor of 1.3 km from Khadki to Range Hills. Maha Metro had submitted its proposal to the defence ministry six months ago and was continuously following it up. With the clearances having arrived, the work on the metro corridor will now be speeded up, he said.",1

306,"Major intersections in Delhi death traps for pedestriansMajor intersections in Delhi are turning into death traps for pedestrians. With the rising number of vehicles and a lack of infrastructure for at-grade (at the surface level) crossings, the number of deaths involving pedestrians continues its steep rise every year.According to Delhi Police estimates, of the 1,604 people killed in road accidents last year, around 40% were pedestrians.(Picture for representation)Major intersections in Delhi are turning into death traps for pedestrians. With the rising number of vehicles and a lack of infrastructure for at-grade (at the surface level) crossings, the number of deaths involving pedestrians continues its steep rise every year. According to Delhi Police estimates, of the 1,604 people killed in road accidents last year, around 40% were pedestrians.The task of crossing at intersectionsCrossing busy intersections is an uphill task most pedestrians face on a regular basis. The art of racing to the other side of the road in a fraction of a second before the signal turns red for one section, and green for the other, is something that Delhiites have mastered over the years.An estimate by the Indian Road Congress (IRC) shows an average pedestrian in Delhi takes around seven to eight minutes to cross a busy intersection from end-to-end.This is because the signal timings often ignore those who mean to reach their final destination. After crossing each carriageway, pedestrians have to make a pit-stop for at least two minutes on dividers before they get to cross again. With proper infrastructure, this time can be reduced to three minutes, road safety experts said.They maintained that at intersections, signal timings should be adjusted with the average time taken by a pedestrian to cross the intersection from one end to the other kept in mind. Any breaks will only result in people jumping in front of vehicles off-turn and ending up risking their lives.Sahil Kumar, a bank employee working in Rohini’s Sector 18, said that during the peak morning traffic, he often has to wave at vehicles to slow down so that he can cross the road.“Most drivers end up hurling abuse at you for suddenly jumping on the road, waving your hand like a traffic police officer. But what option do we have? Waiting for these vehicles to stop will mean waiting for at least 15-20 minutes,” Kumar said. He added that the installation of pedestrian signals will give people like him some breather.“We constantly have drives to educate and fine drivers who stop their vehicles beyond the stop line, eating up on the zebra crossing for pedestrians. Safe roads are everyone’s right,” said joint commissioner of police (traffic) Alok Kumar. He also said that regular meetings are conducted with the road-owning agencies to come up with newer ways to make safe walking spaces for pedestrians.A study conducted by the IRC in 2016 proved that the presence of pedestrian signals on busy roads made people feel safer and decreased fatalities. It also showed pedestrians were willing to wait longer at such signals because of an assurance of safe passage when the lights go green.Lack of pedestrian infrastructureIn a 2013 study by Geetam Tiwari from Indian Institute of Technology (Delhi), the pattern of road accidents across major cities in the country over a span of five years was analysed, and it was confirmed that in the national capital, pedestrian deaths comprised at least 47% of all fatalities — the second highest in India after Mumbai.The reason for this alarming trend can be seen in the way the city’s roads are being designed. Despite studies proving pedestrian tendencies to cross the road at-grade, road-owning agencies are doing little to facilitate safe road crossing and walking facilities for them. The priority is on vehicles, which are the centre of the way the city’s roads are planned, experts said.Tiwari said India has been upgrading its highways with dividers, four- and six-lane roads and expressways since 2000. Yet, deaths due to road accidents continue to rise by 9%-10% each year.“The design completely ignores the requirements of walkers, bicyclists, two-wheeler users, even animal carts and other slow-moving traffic. We need to relook our car-centric road designs,” she said.As cities expand, so does vehicular traffic, but all emphasis is on ensuring better movement for cars, and so “cities are becoming hostile to pedestrians,” she said.Sample this. At the crossing outside the gates of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) on Sri Aurobindo Marg, despite the high pedestrian footfall of patients and their caretakers, there aren’t many avenues for people to cross over to the other side of the road safely, without having to wait endlessly.At the pedestrian signal at the gate, the lack of police presence sucks out any deterrence for speeding vehicles to give way to those looking to cross the road, and the apathy of road-owning agencies can be seen in the barely visible zebra crossing. Experts said that for government agencies, on most roads the only road-crossing facility is a gap between the grilles, through which a person or two can squeeze in.The solutionsTiwari said public spaces will improve if road designs move beyond the car-centric approach. “We need to change the way we design our roads and ensure better enforcement of rules,” she said. Experts stress the need to streamline the road geometry, bring the stop-line closer and make the intersection compact. “This will reduce the distance pedestrians have to walk and give them a sense of direction. We often find wide intersections that pedestrians are unable to cross in one go,” Amit Bhatt, director integrated transport, WRI India, maintained.Table-top crossings at slip roads can bring down the speed of vehicles and provide a smooth crossing facility to pedestrians. “Pedestrians prefer to cross at-grade. A majority of intersections are not well-designed. It is important that we factor in their requirements while redesigning our intersections. There is a need to provide refuge islands wherever possible,” Bhatt said.Also, government awareness programmes on road safety over the last 40 years have made little dent in improving road safety. The world over, research shows that individual behaviour cannot be changed without changing the physical environment in which traffic operates, and ensuring better enforcement of rules.The disadvantaged section of senior citizens and differently abled must be catered to. In most developed countries, provisions of pelican signals are made for the benefit of senior citizens, school children and differently abled, who can turn the pedestrian lights green to cross roads safely",0

They robbed him of his phone, smartwatch and wallet and forced him to withdraw money from ATM. (Shutterstock)Trying to help out an accident victim came at a high price for 24-year-old Rishabh Mandal who was duped, robbed of his valuables, and held captive for over two hours on Friday night.According to Mandal, he was on his way home in Patel Nagar, Delhi, when the incident occurred, near the Noida City Centre Metro station.“I got off an auto-rickshaw around 8pm at the service lane near the Metro station, when a man in his mid twenties approached me. He said his younger sister had met with an accident and was trapped in a car, and said he needed my help to pull her out of the car. I accompanied him to a street nearby to help him out,” Mandal, who is preparing for competitive exams, said.He said they were followed by another person, which was when he realised something was amiss.“The person who was following us asked what was going on. That’s when the tone of the man who asked for my help changed. I realised something was amiss and tried to leave. However, a third person blocked me from behind. One of them pulled out a gun and another held a knife to my throat. They took my phone, smartwatch and wallet. I didn’t have much cash on me so they asked me to withdraw money from any ATM. When I told them that I didn’t have money in the account, they asked me to arrange it and threatened me with dire consequences if I did not comply,” Mandal said.He said a couple of passersby were around. “But I was so scared that I could not approach them and anyone passing by would not have guessed what was going on. I called my elder brother for help. When he didn’t take the call, I called my younger brother and asked him to transfer money to my account,” he said, adding that the accused also suggested several excuses he could give his brother to encourage him to transfer the money.“I withdrew Rs 5,000, which he transferred to me and handed it over. They didn’t come into the ATM kiosk with me for fear of getting captured in the CCTV camera. When they realised that I was scared and was complying with their demands, they got greedier. They took my phone and asked my brother to send more money. They took nearly Rs 28,000 in multiple transactions,” he said.Mandal alleged that he tried to flee but the accused held him captive. “They were manhandling me the whole time and abusing me. They even threatened to kill me. Finally, around 10.10pm, when one of them was on his phone and the other two were talking, I decided to flee. They followed me, but I came upon a wedding party where I asked a few people for help. They gave me Rs 100 and dropped me at the Golf Course Metro station from where I came back home and filed an e-FIR,” said Mandal.Based on his complaint, a case of robbery (Section 392) under the Indian Penal Code was registered at the Sector 24 police station.“An investigation is ongoing in the case, and we will nab the accused soon,” Mithlesh Updhyay, station house officer, Sector 24 police station, said.",0

Gauri Mahadik (32), all set to join the Officers' Training Academy (OTA) at Chennai, said instead of just mourning her husband's death, she wanted to pay a befitting tribute to him by wearing his stars and uniform. Major Mahadik, who had joined the Army in 2012 and commissioned in the 7th Battalion of Bihar Regiment, died in the fire at his camp in Tawang near the Indo-China border in in December 2017. Post-completion of 49-week training at the OTA, Gauri Mahadik, a qualified company secretary and law graduate who recently topped the Service Selection Board (SSB) exam in the widow category, will be inducted into the Army as a Lieutenant by March 2020. ""After my husband's death, I was thinking what to do next...I thought I can not just sit and cry. So I decided that I should do something for him and make him proud. ""I decided to follow his footsteps and with a determination that I will wear his stars and uniform, started preparing for SSB examination,"" said Mahadik while talking to PTI from Virar, a distant suburb of Mumbai, over the phone.

316,"Ministry of Railways plans upgradation of 90 stations ahead of next general electionsModernised railway stations is something Indians have been long promised but it remains a pipe dream. Hopes were raised, yet again, in February when Finance Minister Arun Jaitley announced that 600 railway stations across the country had been picked for modernisation. All a part of the whopping Rs 1.48 trillion allocation to the railways - the highest ever for the sector - in the Modi government's last Budget before the next general elections.But then one remembered that a year earlier, then Railway Minister Suresh Prabhu had launched the first phase of what the ministry called the ""World's largest Station Redevelopment Program"", comprising 23 major railway stations. The idea was to redevelop the stations through the public-private-partnership (PPP) model, where the railways will provide approximately 140 acres of encroachment free land to the developers on a 45 year lease and hence the project would generally be cost neutral to the Railways. Moreover, according to a statement from the ministry at the time, the Rs 1 lakh crore program would benefit more than 100 cities and 16 million passengers per day across the country.Things did not quite pan out that way due to muted private investor interest. Undeterred, the Railways recently came out with a list of 68 stations earmarked for a facelift through its own resources before the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. The cost is pegged at Rs 5,000 crore. ""We can't wait for private investors anymore. We'll redevelop these stations on our own and could monetise them later through commercial exploitation,"" a top rail ministry official earlier told The Economic Times.The new list includes some of the busiest stations in the country like the Old Delhi railway station, Guwahati, Howrah, Patna, Allahabad, Udaipur, Haridwar, Pune, Bengaluru, Ambala, Chennai Egmore and Bhubaneshwar.The redevelopment plan has reportedly been assigned to the zonal railways with a one year deadline for completion. According to the daily, all the shortlisted railway stations will get state-of-the-art amenities, including elevators, swanky waiting room, a modern passenger announcement system, new platforms, shopping complex and airport-like entry and exit. The redevelopment will be closely monitored by the general managers of the respective zones and the divisional railway managers.""While doing this (redevelopment), efforts would be made to showcase local culture or history to reflect in the station facade. For instance Aurangabad station is to be developed on lines of Ajantha or Ellora, Agra station is to be developed on lines of Taj Mahal, Ujjain station is to be developed on lines of Mahakaleshwar temples,"" the ministry said in a statement in March.Apart from the 68 stations announced by the Railways, the redevelopment of the Habibganj railway station in Madhya Pradesh and the Gandhinagar railway station in Gujarat are already racing towards completion and seem on course to meet the December 2018 and January 2019 deadlines, respectively.These two stations have hogged the headlines of late given the impressive list of features they will pack. In case you missed the buzz, the Habibganj station will have a large waiting area comprising over 600 benches with neat and clean toilets and commercial hubs. Of the total Rs 450 crore allocated for the redevelopment of the Habibganj railway station, Rs 100 will be spent on improving the infrastructure, while the rest of the amount will be spent on building glass structures and facilities for food, entertainment, and the waiting area. The Indian Railway Stations Development Corporation Ltd. (IRSDC) is also working on other ideas like installing video game zones and virtual museums to make the station more passenger-friendly and commercially viable.The Gandhinagar railway station, scheduled to be inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi before the Vibrant Gujarat Summit in January 2019, is a special purpose vehicle (SPV) between the IRSDC and the Gujarat government. Around Rs 250 crore have been allocated for its redevelopment and the centre of attraction here will be a 300-room 5-star hotel built 22 metres above the ground, while the railway track will pass underneath it.

It is famous for its natural heritage that is the home for several wildlife animals, including 43 tigers, 15 panthers and around 1800 wild dogs.With an area of 625.40 sq km, the project includes Tadoba National, created in 1955 with an area of 116.55 sq km and Andhari wildlife sanctuary, created in 1986 with an area of 508.85 kms.It said that the tiger conservation in Tadoba national park was commendable for the last one and half decades. The tiger population has been increasing, though slowly, during the period. Population of the big cat in the area was 36 in 1994 census which has now increased by 43 in the last census.In view of its good track record, the Ministry of Environment and Forests also included the tiger reserve in its pilot project for mapping wildlife sanctuaries and parks by the Wildlife Institute of India, Dehradun. Rs 1.39-crore was sanctioned for the pilot project that would be completed in 36 months. Out of the five sites selected for this pilot project, three were tiger reserves - Tadoba-Andhari, Dudhwa and Corbett. The identified targets included generation of satellite data and securing the survey of India topographic maps.Talking to Hindustan Times, B Majumder, the PCCF (wildlife), and Maharashtra state said that by providing mobile and landline network, the park would certainly be able to benefit the tourists and forest personnel who are working there for wildlife conservation. “We are expecting more tourists after starting this facility,” he further claimed and informed that the BSNL was exploring to provide such facility in the locality.Meanwhile, the MTDC with the help of ministry and Railway and the ministry of Tourism is planning to start an exclusive narrow gauge vintage train from Nagpur to Nagbhir (near Tadoba) for tourists, an answer to the to Nagbhir (near Tadoba) for tourists, an answer to the Palace of Wheels in Rajasthan. The plan, which was postponed because of numerous reasons, would begin from January next.",1

320,"More MPs likely to quit parties in key Brexit weekThe prospect of more MPs quitting Conservative and Labour parties hung heavy over Westminster as Prime Minister Theresa May braced for a key week in parliament with a little over a month to go for the UK to leave the European Union on March 29.Labour deputy leader Tom Watson admitted on Sunday the party had to change to ensure more MPs do not take the extreme step of resigning, while May’s cabinet was under strain to maintain collective responsibility with three ministers openly, and others covertly, toeing new lines.Three cabinet ministers - business secretary Greg Clark, justice secretary David Gauke and works and pensions secretary Amber Rudd have already favoured extension to Article 50 to delay Brexit beyond March 29.May has been cautioned by senior advisors that she cannot sack ministers who vote this week to delay Brexit without causing a further rupture within her party, given the growing number of ministers and MPs reportedly in favour of delaying it.May used a party convention in Oxford to reiterate her position that has led to much hand-wringing inside and outside her party, as well as in Brussels: “Our focus to deliver Brexit must be absolute”.“We must not, and I will not, frustrate what was the largest democratic exercise in this country’s history. In the very final stages of this process, the worst thing we could do is lose our focus,” she said.As the newly-formed The Independent Group attracted funds from small and major donors worth “tens of thousands of pounds”, as former Labour MP Chuka Umunna put it, he called upon the British public to join the formation for a new kind of politics.He wrote in the Sunday Mirror: “This week we have come together in the national interest, to say ‘enough is enough’. We have each put everything on the line to give something new a try. Believe me, it wasn’t an easy decision for any of us”.“We don’t yet know the destination where the path we’ve taken will lead us. But what me and my Independent Group colleagues are absolutely clear about is that we cannot and must not recreate the old parties with their tribalism and incompetence”.",0
321,"More Staff For Railway Protection Force In Kashmir After Pulwama AttackThe Railway Protection Force (RPF) has increased the number of its personnel in Kashmir following the terror attack in Pulwama to ensure the safety of train passengers and to protect railway property, a senior official of the force said.A total of 40 CRPF personnel were killed and five injured on February 14 in a terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir when a Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammad suicide bomber rammed a vehicle carrying over 100 kg of explosives into their bus in Pulwama district.""We had a meeting with the Ministry of Home Affairs yesterday where the decision was taken to increase the presence of RPF in the region,"" said RPF DG Arun Kumar.""The chairman railway board also had a detailed security briefing with all zonal and divisional RPF officers on the security of railways. It was decided that a company of RPF will be sent to Kashmir for additional security,"" he said.While four companies of the RPF are stationed in Kashmir, one more, with 125 personnel, will be airlifted from Jammu to the area, he added.",1
322,"MoS Railways dubs Railway Protection Force as 'toothless', demands more power for it Dubbing the RPF as a ""toothless"" organisation, Minister of State for Railways Manoj Sinha on Wednesday strongly pitched for more powers for it even as his senior ministerial colleague Piyush Goyal played down his concerns, asserting that regardless of a law they should move on with their work Goyal also said an amendment to the existing Railways Act was only a ""technicality"", and urged the Railway Protection Force (RPF) and the Government Railway Police (GRP) to work together to secure railways and passengers. Speaking at a conference on security of railways, both Sinha and RPF Director General Arun Kumar pushed for handing over the registration, enquiry and detection of passenger-related crimes on board running trains to the force. Currently, even if a crime is detected by the RPF, the case has to be handed over to the GRP for further enquiry. RPF is a toothless organisation. It is involved in security, but has no powers. Despite ability and efforts, the RPF has not got the powers it deserves. However, it is blamed for everything that happens on railway premises. But the reality is that other than taking care (of railway property), RPF has no real powers. An amendment in the law, I personally feel, is the need of the hour,"" Sinha said However, Goyal asserted that ""whether the law is changed or not, whether the GRP does it or the RPF, these are all technicalities. We have to decide that we need to work together to secure passengers. Then law will not come in the way."" The RPF DG also highlighted how his force can leverage its inherent advantage of having an all India jurisdiction to prevent and detect crime in moving trains. Since the jurisdiction of an RPF posts cuts across jurisdiction of many police stations, it has an advantage of identifying place of occurrence, quick registration of the case and subsequent detection, Kumar added. ""Therefore, we may consider empowering RPF to register, investigate and detect passenger luggage thefts so that the state police can concentrate on checking serious crimes like robbery, dacoity, rape, murder and focus its efforts in maintenance of law and order in railway premises. ""A draft bill for amendment in Railways Act to empower RPF to register, enquire and prosecute cases of passenger luggage theft and crime against women has been approved to be sent to the cabinet for further legislative action,"" he said.

323,"MoU Signed For Development Of Railway Infrastructure In TelanganaIn the august presence of Chairman, Railway Board Shri A.K. Mital an Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between Ministry of Railways and State Government of Telangana for “Formation of Joint Venture Companies for Development of Railway Infrastructure in the State of Telangana” has been signed.On the event of Signing Ceremony, Chairman Railway Board Shri A. K. Mital, Member Engineering Shri V. K. Gupta, Member Staff Shri Pradip Kumar, Secretary Railway Board Shri R. K. Verma and other Board Members and Senior Officials were present. On behalf of the Railway Ministry Shri Ved Prakash Dudeja, Executive Director/Works signed the MoU whereas on behalf of Government of Telangana, Shri Sunil Sharma, Principal Secretary, Department of Transport, Roads & Buildings, Govt. of Telangana signed the MoU. Dr. Shashank Goel, Resident Commissioner, Govt. of Telangana was present among others. The MoU was signed in the backdrop of Railway Minister’s Budget announcement regarding setting up of Joint Ventures with States for focused project development, resource mobilization, land acquisition, project implementation and monitoring of critical rail projects.Speaking on the occasion, Chairman Railway Board stated that Railways has a big shelf of projects valuing about 3.5 lakh crore. Last year, Railways had sanctioned additional lines of nine thousand kilometres. There has always been lot of expectations from various States for new railway lines/lands. Thus, to meet the demands of the States, a Cabinet note was got approved for formation of JV Companies. He stated that 17 States have already consented for formation of JV Companies in their respective States and 5 States have already signed MoUs with Railway Ministry in this regard which are Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, Odisha. He stated that today’s MoU will help in putting the execution of railways projects on fast track.  He stated that this will also help to take into account the priorities of the States because these projects will be finalized in consultation with the States as there would be offices from State Governments as well as Railways in the new Company which will be formed.  He stated that this is very welcome step which takes the partnership of State and Centre together to take railway projects on very fast pace. Salient Features of the MoU:-  In view of the growing demands for railway lines in various states and huge requirement of funds to execute them, Minister for Railways announced in his budget speech regarding setting up of Joint Ventures with states for focused project development, resource mobilization, land acquisition, project implementation and monitoring of critical rail projects. 17 State Governments consented for formation of Joint Venture Companies in collaboration with the Ministry of Railways for development of rail infrastructure in their respective States. Draft MoU were sent to these State Governments and discussions were also held with them to clarify various provisions of the MoU.MoUs have already been signed by the Ministry of Railways with the State Governments of Odisha, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Kerala and Chhattisgarh.Today, MoUs are being signed with the State Governments of Telangana. This signing of MOU is going to be a stepping stone for formation of JV companies.The MoU envisages formation of a Joint Venture companies having 51% stakes of the respective State Government and 49% stakes of Ministry of Railways. Thus, the JV companies shall be fully owned by the Government. The companies will primarily identify projects and possible financing avenues in addition to Govt of India and the State Governments. After finances for a project are tied up, project specific SPVs or special purpose vehicles shall be formed. These SPVs can have other stake holders from Industries, Central PSUs, and State PSUs etc. However, the JV companies shall be mandatory stake holders with minimum 26% shares in the SPVs.The ministry of Railways will sign a concession agreement of 30 years with the project SPV for safe and sound operation, revenue sharing and providing technical & marketing logistics to the SPV. The revenue sharing shall be based on already established formula being used for inter zonal apportionment of revenue.The most important aspect of this MoU is that the ownership of the land shall vest with the SPVs which are a departure from previous practice. This will give financial leverage to the company to exploit commercial potential of the land. This is likely to result in making project viable which are otherwise not viable.At the end of concession period, the railways will have option to take over the assets at a nominal price. This is largely in line with average codal life of the assets as most of the assets will need large scale replacement after 30 years.Indian Railways has been playing a major role in national integration by connecting the remotest places and bringing people closer to each other. Railways receive a large number of demands for network expansion as a railway line acts as an engine of growth for the area it serves.However, Railways have a large shelf of ongoing New Line, Gauge Conversion and Doubling projects needing about Rs 3.5 lakh crores to complete. We have been trying to meet the aspirations of public within limited availability of funds.To expedite the projects, Railways have been trying to mobilize resources through other than Gross Budgetary Support. However, on the initiative of Minister for Railways Sh. Suresh Prabhu, Indian Railways have tied up funds for critical capacity enhancement project of doubling, third line, electrification etc. A MoU was signed with LIC of India and we have already taken first tranche of Rs 2000 Cr for these projects. This tied up loan will ensure dedicated and assured funding for such critical projects.Indian Railways have targeted to commission 2000 Km New Lines, 4000 Km Gauge Conversion and 11000 Km Doubling/Tripling/ Quadrupling projects over 5 years i.e. from 2015-16 to 2019-20. In 2015-16, we had kept quite ambitious target of commissioning 2500 Km Broad Gauge track. It is a matter of great satisfaction that we are poised to not only achieve these targets but to surpass them. We have already commissioned about 1300 Km Broad Gauge track till December, 2015 against 800 Km track commissioned in the corresponding period of the previous year (Due to monsoons, major commissioning takes place in the last quarter of the financial year).Formation of Joint Venture Companies with the State Governments will go a long way in faster commissioning of critical rail infrastructure projects as it will not only help in mobilization of funds but also in facilitating various clearances and land acquisition.",1

The handset instead uses light sensors to scan the veins in a user’s hand or to recognise their face.The phone’s front-facing camera, which uses a sensor chip developed by Germany’s Infineon Technologies , can scan in three dimensions - making it more secure than existing biometric methods of unlocking phones such as fingerprints.LG product evangelist David Montanya told a launch event it would be harder to ‘spoof’ than the FaceID feature used in Apple’s iPhone X because the vein structure in a user’s hand has less than one chance in a billion of being the same as anyone else’s.Users can also activate features with gestures - for example to play or pause a song or video, or adjust the volume, by twisting their fingers, emulating the character played by Tom Cruise in science-fiction detective thriller Minority Report.LG did not set release dates or announce prices for the new phones, but said the 5G model should hit stores in the first half of the year.",0
325,"Mumbai rail roko | Highlights: Protest called off, but agitators warn of another stir; train services resumeCommuters in Mumbai travelling on the Central Railway (CR)?struggled on Tuesday, after railway apprentices decided to protest against the railway recruitment system by resorting to rail roko between Matunga and Dadar railway stations on the main line during the morning rush hours.The railways select and appoint apprentices for various technical jobs, to be done in their various workshops across India. Earlier, these apprentices were absorbed into the railways as they got preference during recruitments. However, in 2016, the railway ministry decided to stop this and offer them just a 20% quota. Since then, ,many apprentices have not been able to get railway jobs and have been staging protests.Protesters on Tuesday blocked all the CR?lines, so both the slow and fast local train services ahead of Matunga have been shut completely, forcing commuters to walk on tracks. “Due to some agitation between Matunga and Dadar, rail traffic has been affected between Matunga and CSMT,” said Sunil Udasi, chief public relations officer, CR.The agitation started after 7am, and went on for around three-and-a-half hours.Here are the highlights:11.51am: Protesters head to Bandra (east), likely to meet MNS?chief Raj Thackeray at MIG Club.11.30am: Tracks cleared and trains running.

326,"Mumbai railway train commute is as noisy as an alarm clock ringing constantlyHear this. Your daily train commute on the Mumbai suburban railway is as noisy as an alarm clock ringing constantly, according to a study. While the study revealed that the Western Railway is the noisiest at 119.1 dB — as loud as a steel factory, the Central Railway is quieter, but only marginally, at 91.6dB.Non-governmental organisation (NGO) Awaaz Foundation measured noise using decibel meters from an old train between Bandra station and Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus (CST) on the harbour line, a new train between CST and Thane station and both old and new trains between Churchgate and Virar stations on the western line. While Virar station was the noisiest on the western line, Byculla station and Mahim junction were the noisiest on the harbour and central lines respectively.“Railway noise levels have been a huge source of stress, which has not been recognised up till now. After our readings were made public, complaints have been pouring in about how much it affects their daily life. This is just the beginning and there is a lot more to be done to reduce this source of noise pollution,” said Sumaira Abdulali, convener, Awaaz Foundation. “All types of travel are an integral part of people’s lives. The Centre needs to restrict noise levels on the suburban railways, like it has been done by the Airport Authority of India, which made the Mumbai airport a silent one.”Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) officials said that the readings were a cause for concern and pose a serious threat to people’s lives as they are exposed to such levels daily. “We will be raising the issue with the Union environment ministry and the railway ministry as noise readings close to 120dB is dangerous for even healthy people if they are exposed to it daily,” said D Saha, additional director, CPCB.",1
327,"Mumbai rain: Late trains, traffic snarls, water, scary wall collapse, et al. Mumbai came to a standstill on Monday -- just a few days after the onset of monsoon -- as overnight rains led to the usual chaos of delayed trains, water-logged roads, horrific traffic snarls, and a rather scary wall collapse in a central neighbourhood of the city. Four people have died in the last 24 hours in the city and its suburbs. A 15-year-old died after falling into an open pit in Malad. Another 13-year-old was killed in a wall collapse in thane. Two died yesterday when a tree collapsed on them near Azad Maidan in South Mumbai. A large part of the boundary wall of a plush apartment complex in Wadala collapsed and subsided in the morning, burying nearly a dozen cars. The damaged cars, mostly belonging to residents of the complex -- Lloyds  Estate -- were stuck in debris.Local trains, the city's life line, were running behind schedule as usual, at the hint of the first heavy rains this season. Water-logging was reported from low-lying areas and office-goers and vehicles found it difficult to navigate roads in large parts of the city.  Meanwhile, Mumbai's civic body officials placed pumps on stand-by in neighbourhoods that are prone to water-logging.  The Indian Meteorological Department has said that heavy to very heavy rains are expected to continue.Two people died and five were injured on Sunday after a tree fell on them near Metro Cinema at MG Road in South Mumbai's Marine Lines area, according to news agency ANI.A 13-year-old boy was killed and his parents were injured when an adjacent wall collapsed on their house at Wadol village in Ambernath taluka of Thane around 2:15 am today, the district civic body's regional disaster management cell chief Santosh Kadam told news agency PTI. In another incident, a 65-feet compound wall of a housing complex in Thane city collapsed this morning, crushing two cars and another vehicle, he said.  On Sunday, Mumbai recorded the highest amount of rainfall at 110.80 mm between 8:30 am and 4:30 pm, a Met department official said.",1
328,"Mumbai stampede: Tragedy is fallout of misplaced prioritiesIt is a sad irony. The stampede took place at Elphinstone Road station on the day railway minister Piyush Goyal was to visit Mumbai and get a first-hand experience of the struggle millions of daily commuters face as they commute between work place and home in overcrowded trains. In fact, the railway officials were also considering an event to rename Elphinstone Road station during Goyal’s visit to Mumbai on Friday, but it was somehow put on hold.For the past few years, commuters’ associations and activists have been raising the issue of overcrowded foot overbridges and narrow staircases at Parel and Elphinstone Road stations and warning the authorities that there could be a stampede-like situation here. The Hindustan Times published several reports on the subject. A plan for makeover of the two stations on two different suburban lines (central and western) joined by a narrow foot overbridge was prepared a few years ago. However, typically it was not given priority. On the other hand, a political demand to rename Elphinstone Road station as Prabhadevi was taken up on urgent basis and a notification was issued by the railway ministry in no time.Anybody who takes a glance at the two stations during morning and evening peak hours can tell there is an urgent need to rebuild their basic infrastructure. In fact, not just Parel and Elphinstone Road, but some other stations in central Mumbai have been witnessing similar problems. Following the redevelopment of mill land, in which defunct textile mills gave way to skyscrapers housing commercial offices, central Mumbai’s Parel-Worli belt became a commercial hub. Footfall at these stations saw a massive increase. The railway officials, however, are slow to react to the development and the outcome is there to see.Even the Maharashtra government and Mumbai civic body who gave permission for vertical development of central Mumbai should share the blame for the incident. Both the state and city governments were well aware of the development in the area, but did little to upgrade the infrastructure there.The incident also raises questions over the way the suburban railway network is governed by the railway ministry.The railway ministry is taking up projects such as air-conditioned trains, elevated railway corridors and above all, the Rs1,00,000-crore Mumbai-Ahmedabad bullet train. There could be a case for planning for the future, but what about the need to improve and upgrade basic infrastructure at railway stations? Shouldn’t that be a priority?Experts and commuters’ associations have been demanding there should be a separate cadre to handle the suburban train networks at mega cities like Mumbai, as the top railway officers often fail to understand how the Mumbai suburban section, which is used daily by over 7 million commuters, needs to be run. Maybe, it’s time to consider this demand as well.",1

After the approval, we will start identification of land. Banks will also be approached for loan,” said an MRVC official.With the expansion of the suburban railway network, the railway authorities have clubbed major projects under the umbrella of MUTP-3A. Procurement of 210 AC local trains, elevated corridor between CSMT- Panvel, too, are included in it. The project will increase the operational capacity of the western railway, further segregating suburban and long distance traffic up to Virar. It will also provide east-west connectivity to the extended suburbs of Mumbai.",1

Banks will also be approached for loan,” said an MRVC official.With the expansion of the suburban railway network, the railway authorities have clubbed major projects under the umbrella of MUTP-3A. Procurement of 210 AC local trains, elevated corridor between CSMT- Panvel, too, are included in it. The project will increase the operational capacity of the western railway, further segregating suburban and long distance traffic up to Virar. It will also provide east-west connectivity to the extended suburbs of Mumbai.",1

332,"Mumbai: Railways to evict illegal hawkers from entry and exit points of stations, FOBs In a bid to prevent incidents like the Elphinstone station stampede that claimed 23 lives, the railway administration has undertaken a drive to evict illegal hawkers from the entry and exit points of the station as well as from the foot overbridges to ease commuter movement.Twenty-three persons were killed in the stampede on a foot overbridge (FOB) linking two railways stations in Mumbai on Friday during the deadly rush hour. ""Though action against hawkers is undertaken on a regular basis, from October 1, this drive has been intensified with a combined operation launched by the RPF and GRP, and moreover they will also be patrolling the FoBs,"" said chief spokesperson of the Western Railway Ravinder Bhakar.However, passengers and railway representatives want permanent eviction of hawkers and have warned the railway officials that they would report to the Railways Minister if the hawkers return to do business at these spots.Bhakar said Western Railway administration is soon going to demarcate the railway area to stop this menace forever.He said, ""Most of the complaints against hawkers we receive, fall under the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) area where we do not have our administrative control. So we are blamed unnecessarily. Therefore, we have decided to demarcate our periphery and we will keep full vigil within our jurisdiction.""The Central Railway too has launched a drive against illegal hawkers at several stations including Ghatkopar, Kurla, Byculla, Mulund.Eviction of hawkers paved way for smooth movement of commuters near railway stations and on foot overbridges.Senior PRO of Central Railway A K Jain said, ""Though our security forces, keep driving away unauthorised hawkers, they have been now been asked to deal strictly with them.""Rajiv Singal, who has been a member of Railway Users Consultative Committees in Central Railway and Western Railway, however, dubs this exercise of evicting hawkers as merely an ""eyewash"".Singal said, ""This is simply dressing up and no permanent cure. It is showoff because audit team is doing their job and media pressure is working. I can bet you, hawkers will be back again.""""Until and unless, disciplinary action is not taken against the senior RPF officials in whose jurisdiction hawkers operate, nothing is going to change,"" Singal said.T N Dubey, former member of Divisional Railway Users Consultative Committees in Western Railway, said, ""If hawkers come back, we will write to the Railways Minister and draw his attention to the issue.""

336,"Odisha to implement PM-KISAN; farmers to benefit from central and state schemesChief minister Naveen Patnaik’s government had earlier been noncommittal on the PM’s farm intervention scheme as well.By MEERA MOHANTYBHUBANESHWAR: The Odisha government has agreed to implement the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN), deciding to share the first list of beneficiaries under its own farm-intervention programme for the Centre’s cash-transfer scheme. Chief minister Naveen Patnaik’s government, which had refused to implement the Ayushman Bharat central health insurance scheme, had earlier been noncommittal on the PM’s farm intervention scheme as well. The Centre is expected to formally launch the PM-KISAN scheme, announced in the interim budget 2019-20, at a farmers’ conclave in Gorakhpur in Uttar Pradesh on February 24. The onus on identifying beneficiaries for it has been placed with the states. Preoccupied with a state-wide rollout of its own Krushak Assistance for Livelihood and Income Augmentation (KALIA) scheme — it covers sharecroppers and landless agriculture labour as well — the state government had not decided who would qualify for the central scheme. On Thursday, the state announced it would share the list of 12.45 lakh small and marginal farmers who had received the first instalment of Rs 5,000 under the KALIA scheme. These farmers, holding up to 2 hectares of land, in the state now stand to gain an additional Rs 6,000 in three instalments through the year under the PM-KISAN scheme. Addressing a gathering of farmers at Sohela in Bargarh district, Patnaik on Thursday launched the Phase-II of KALIA. The scheme has been praised by economists for not being a loan waiver and including sharecroppers and landless farmers. Those with landholding get an assistance of Rs 25,000 (over five cropping seasons) while sharecroppers and the landless farmers get Rs 12,500 in three instalments. Patnaik’s said: “It is very sad that the Centre’s scheme does not have anything for these neglected and deprived sections (sharecroppers and landless farmers). I have taken up the issue with the Prime Minister and demanded steps for supporting the landless farmers, sharecroppers and agricultural workers and protecting their interests.” He also wanted the assistance to be enhanced from Rs 6,000 to Rs 10,000. The KALIA juggernaut — with posters, billboards, and conventions sweeping the countryside — has practically the entire state machinery occupied even as Patnaik’s Biju Janata Dal aims for a fifth-term in the government. The government’s latest announcement is KALIA scholarships. The state government, which claims to have already paid 16 lakh farmers, said on Thursday it distributed money to another 14 lakh small and marginal farmers.",0
337,"Opinion |?BJP needs another Modi waveWhat do the most recent state elections tell us about the likely fortunes of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the 2019 national election?The BJP lost the elections in all three of the Hindi belt states that went to the polls in November and December, including two states (Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh) it had controlled for 15 years. This continued a string of weaker-than-expected electoral performances (e.g., Bihar, Gujarat) in states where the BJP had a dominant performance in the 2014 national election.BJP partisans remind us that national elections are very different from state elections and that one should not extrapolate from these results — Modi’s charisma and popularity will loom large in 2019, they argue. Meanwhile, the Opposition sees these results as unmistakeable evidence that the BJP will be greatly weakened in 2019.Political punditry aside, what do state elections really tell us about national elections?It should be clear that state-level voter preferences play a major role even in national elections. Several state-level political parties such as the Trinamool Congress (TMC), the Biju Janata Dal (BJD) or the Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) are likely to win many seats in the Lok Sabha, even though they do not have clearly articulated national agendas. This is a natural consequence of the fact that a party’s capacity to deliver benefits and infrastructure such as roads and schools locally and the strength of the local party organisation are among the most significant determinants of a popularity (even in national elections) — and strong regional parties often perform well on these criteria. At the same time, charismatic leaders such as Indira Gandhi or Narendra Modi, and specific issues or policies like the Ram Janmabhoomi movement or the popularity of the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (NREGS) have helped the BJP or the Congress disproportionately in national elections.In some ways, a party’s performance in Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan is likely to be more predictive of the outcome even in national elections; they also do not have the coalition dynamics of Karnataka or Uttar Pradesh and are largely straight BJP/Congress contests. The BJP won state contests in Chhattisgarh, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh in 2007 and 2008, and also won these states in the 2009 national election, even in the face of a commanding performance by Congress nationally. The BJP won all four states in 2012 and 2013, and swept them in the 2014 national election. Of the 91 parliamentary constituencies (PCs) in these four states, the BJP won an eye-popping 88 seats, a strike rate of 97%. About 31% of all seats the BJP won in 2014 came from just these four states.Data from the Election Commission of India (ECI) allows the analysis of national election results down to state assembly constituency (AC) level.Chart 1 displays the AC-level vote share for the BJP in 2012 and 2013 state elections with the AC-level vote share for the BJP in the 2014 national election. There is clearly strong statistical relationship — state electoral results predict national results. For every 10% increase in AC-level vote share for the BJP in a state election, there is a roughly 5.7% increase in vote share in the 2014 national election. To be sure, the 2014 result was more than a repeat of past state results. It was a wave election, and Narendra Modi had a major effect. In these four states, the BJP had an average vote share of 45% in state elections but an average of 55% in the 2014 national election.This implies a Modi effect — the extra bump to BJP’s vote share in going from state to national elections — of about 10%. This 10% was not distributed uniformly, some areas saw much larger increases than 10% and some areas saw much less.Cut to the present situation. In 2017 and 2018, the average vote share of the BJP in state elections in these four states dropped to 41%. Given the poorer performance in these four states (it retained Gujarat and lost the other three), and the uneven distribution of the Modi effect, how will the BJP perform in 2019?Chart 2 displays the predicted number of seats in these four states in the 2019 national election using a statistical model accounting for the relationship between state and national results and the scale of the Modi effect (and its uneven distribution) — all based on how the 2012 and 2013 state election data predict the 2014 results.If there is a Modi effect at 2014 Modi wave levels, then the BJP can be expected to win about 83 seats in 2019, only five less than in 2014. But if the Modi effect drops to about 5% (that’s still a fairly large effect), then the BJP will only win about 65 out of the 91 seats in these four states.If there is no Modi effect, then the party will win just 37 seats.When combined with a stronger opposition coalition in Uttar Pradesh, the BJP will have a tough time returning to power in such a scenario.The BJP will need to repeat its commanding performance in these four states if it is to win again. No one can really say what will be the electoral impact of the BJP’s announcement of reservations for economically backward classes or the Pulwama attack.But this analysis underscores one simple point. The BJP will have to manufacture another Modi wave if it is to return to power in 2019.",0

See all the photos of JLo and Kareena’s matching looks before you say no.Kareena Kapoor might not have attended the 2019 Oscars. However, photos of the Bollywood actor’s stunning metallic dress from a recent awards function have everyone comparing her sparkly dress to one worn by actor-singer Jennifer Lopez at the 91st Academy Awards in Los Angeles on Monday. JLo might not have been nominated for an Oscar, but she made sure to leave quite the impression on the red carpet, dressed in head-to-toe sparkle, courtesy of fashion designer Tom Ford. For the star-studded occasion, JLo, who also presented an Oscar, teamed her shimmering metallic long-sleeved gown with sleek wavy hair and stunning diamond jewellery. Interestingly, Jennifer Lopez’s Oscars dress looks a lot like Kareena Kapoor’s equally mirrored and sparkling dress by Dubai-based fashion designer, Atelier Zuhra. Take a look JLo and Kareena’s silver dresses that screamed maximalist glamour:While these Jennifer Lopez and Kareena Kapoor dresses bear obvious resemblance to one another — both have mock necks, which elongate their silhouettes — JLo’s shiny floor-length look is (as expected) more red carpet than Kareena’s sleeveless ankle-length dress. JLo’s figure-hugging Tom Ford gown was covered in mosaic mirrored tiles and glistened under the bright lights on the red carpet of Hollywood’s biggest night. Jennifer Lopez added even more shine to her glam by wearing a chunky diamond ring and matching earrings.Kareena Kapoor’s fitted dress, which she wore to the Social Media Summit and Awards 2018 in November, was also decorated with mosaic crystal embellishments, but offered a more fun, party vibe. It featured Atelier Zuhra’s signature shattered mosaic crystal mirrors — inspired by Barcelona’s Gaudí architecture. Another similarity between Kareena and Jennifer’s looks? Their make-up. Both JLo and Kareena wore a dramatic smoky eye to complement their metallic dresses. While, the jury is still out on whether Jennifer Lopez’ Tom Ford gown was inspired by Kareena Kapoor’s Atelier Zuhra design, our guess is not — considering both JLo and Tom Ford don’t need much inspiration to churn out fashion gold (or silver).",0
339,"Pakistan’s house of cards: How its purported aces have been trumpedSome of Pakistan’s purported aces have been trumped by New Delhi over the years, others have been neutralised, and some have outlived their utility. Here are nine cards Pakistan has played against India.By Chidanand RajghattaPakistan has used various “trump” cards over the decades to stalk and stall India’s growth fuelled by being an open, democratic and plural society despite some recent challenges. Some of Pakistan’s purported aces have been trumped by New Delhi over the years, others have been neutralised, and some have outlived their utility. Here are nine cards Pakistan has played against India. The American Card: Used from the time Pakistan was formed when its leaders quickly allied with Washington even as India stumbled into the Soviet orbit. The end of the Cold War, the collapse of the Soviet Union, India’s economic reforms and subsequent growth, the Kargil war, and 9/11 (which had Pakistan’s fingerprints on it) resulted in Pakistan losing this hand. The Afghan Card: Fearful of India’s size and growing heft, Pakistan has long sought “strategic depth” in Afghanistan by installing a friendly, puppet regime in Kabul, a strategy that resulted in the coming to power of Taliban in 1996 (and eventually led to 9/11). But Pakistani overreach built on a Sunni-Wahhabi construct has ruined this card. Except in Taliban pockets, Pakistan is now despised by most Afghans who see it as a malign force. The Kashmir Card: A card the Pakistan military and its elites have played since 1947 to corner resources. Most poor Pakistanis care squat about Kashmir, which is “cash mere” for the Pakistani military as it dips its hand in the till. The Pakistani establishment continues to lie to its own people about UN Resolution (47) on Kashmir (which actually enjoins that Pakistan should first withdraw from the areas it has occupied before other steps). With the passage of time, changes in demographics etc, the resolution, which was non-binding in the first place, is now infructuous. But Pakistan won’t accept it because peace would mean having to whittle down its military budget. The Saudi Card: In this petro dollars-for-nuclear cover deal, the House of Saud has long backed and bankrolled Pakistan, acquiring an outsized influence on its domestic politics to the extent that it is a go-to place for Pakistanis in retirement or exile. But Saudis themselves have embarked on a nuclear quest, and India’s growing influence (it has greater number of workers and white collar workers) means Pakistan’s influence is being reduced down despite Ummah solidarity. As Crown Prince Salman suggested to his hosts last week, when living next to the world’s #3 and #2 economies Pakistan would benefit from peace. The Muslim Ummah Card: Over the years, Pakistan has presented itself as a champion of the Islamic world and has singularly prevented India from acquiring even an observer status in the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), whose associates go beyond the 50-Muslim majority countries in the world (Russia and Thailand for instance have observer status). India, which has the world’s second largest Muslim population after Indonesia, has gradually increased its influence in the the Islamic world (particularly in the Gulf), and a breakthrough is inevitable. But its task will be made difficult if the Hindutva hotheads at home run amuck. The Russia Card: As India has gravitated towards the United States and Pakistan has lost traction in Washington, Islamabad has tried to woo countries such as Russia, Turkey and even Iran in the hope of strengthening its China card. But it is a weak hand. Pakistan is so caught up in domestic radicalisation and internecine bloodletting that few countries have any confidence in its long-term prospects. And despite India’s on-again, off-again ties with these countries, New Delhi interest and influence on account of its economic heft. The China Card (and for China, Pakistan Card): China finds it useful to constrain India using Pakistan. The day India begins to use demographic, economic and cultural clout, the usefulness of this card could diminish. Just think of all the Chinese phones we buy, the general size of the Indian market. China will also not want to import Pakistan’s radicalisation into its sensitive Xinjiang province. The Terrorism Card: Pakistan’s most potent card, an extension of its “death by thousand cut” policy following its defeat in the 1971 war. India’s weaknesses, including in its security doctrine, and global indifference, had enabled Pakistan to export terror (its principal export) and get away, literally, with murder. New Delhi has failed to sensitise world capitals of Pakistani fingerprints on not just terror attacks in India but in many other places across the world. The Nuclear Card: Pakistan’s ultimate trump card that gives cover to its terrorism, one that India failed to take care of between 1971 and 1984 by which time it was too late. The Nuclear Card: Pakistan’s ultimate trump card that gives cover to its terrorism, one that India failed to take care of between 1971 and 1984 by which time it was too late. Remarkably, Pakistan does not have a Pakistan card. The world’s sixth most populous nation has the sixth largest army (and is a nuclear power to boot), but its economy is ranked 24th in size. Maharashtra has a larger economy, and Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Gujarat will each overtake it soon. Nearly Nearly ten times the size of Pakistan’s economy, India is adding one Pakistan to its GDP each year, and will have an economy roughly 40 times larger by 2050. This growing imbalance is actually what makes the Pakistani military reckless in its support of terrorism. New Delhi has only one card – the India card. Playing a cool, calculated, and cohesive hand, while quietly attriting Pakistan, economically and through covert payback, without the hysteria, histrionics and grandstanding currently on display, will yield better results. The Pakistani house of cards will inevitably collapse.",0
340,"Panel wants railway ministry to create body to regulate faresA parliamentary committee wants the railway ministry to create the body it has long promised to, that will, among other things, regulate fares.In its latest report, the Railway Convention Committee of Parliament maintained that since the proposed authority is yet to take a final shape, “consideration of suitable subsidy sharing mechanism is yet to begin.”Parties in power rarely increase passenger fares, irrespective of the carrier’s financial health , given the political ramifications of such a move. The idea to set up an independent body to suggest fare hikes and other reforms was mooted during the United Progressive Alliance’s (UPA) tenure.In April 2017, the NDA government first approved the setting up of the Rail Development Authority (RDA), to make “Pricing of services commensurate with costs, suggest measures for enhancement of Non Fare Revenue, protection of consumer interests, by ensuring quality of service and cost optimization, promoting competition, efficiency and economy”, among other things.The RDA didn’t start functioning and railway ministry officials recently suggested that the creation of the body could take even more time, with parliamentary elections around the corner.The House panel, led by BJD’s Bhartruhari Mahtab, noted that “in view of the fact that the principals of sharing subsidies/ social costs involve reimbursement of such costs to the railways by finance ministry and other departments, the committee stress that the process of establishment of the proposed Railway Regulatory Authority be expedited.”The Parliamentary panel supported the idea of the merger of the rail budget with the general budget—a practice started since 2017—but expressed concern that a decision to demarcate between commercial and social activities of the Indian rail and the reimbursement of the social service obligation has not been done so far.",1
341,"Pepper traders cite Sri Lankan minister statement on illegal imports to IndiaIn a letter to the commerce minister, pepper consortium has raised concerns over spurt in illegal imports of Vietnam pepper.ET Bureau|Feb 12, 2019, 07.57 PM ISTKOCHI: The pepper traders have appealed to the commerce ministry to take steps to raise vigil to prevent the import of pepper from Vietnam through Sri Lanka with origin of certificate from the latter, citing the recent statement by a Sri Lankan minister in media. Kishore Shamji, the coordinator of the Kerala chapter of Indian Pepper and Spice Traders, Growers , Planters Consortium said in a letter to commerce minister Suresh Prabhu that Sri Lankan minister has said that he hasn’t been able to prevent the export of 156 containers of Vietnam pepper to India with certificate of origin from Sri Lanka as it is a racket similar to narcotics trafficking. ``We have been cautioning the Indian government since last week of January that 180 containers of about 1800 to 2000 tonnes of such pepper have left Sri Lankan coast,’’ he said.. This is over and above the pepper smuggled to India from Myanmar, Bangladesh and Nepal, he added The supply of Vietnam pepper is happening by evading duty to the tune of 43% as the duty for import from Vietnam is 51% against 8% for Sri Lanka under India Sri lanka Free Trade Agreement, circumventing the minimum import price of Rs 500 per kg fixed by India for pepper imports. Shamji said the Indian importer pays the minimum import price of Rs 500 ($ 7100 per tonne), for which duty comes to Rs 40 at 8%. Since the Sri Lankan pepper price is $ 3000 per tonne, the balance $4100 is in many cases not remitted. Those who are paying $ 7100 in full gets back the excess money through hawala in cash in Indian rupees. ` In both cases it is a violation of FEMA rules,’’ he alleged. He said such pepper are sold in Indian markets below the domestic price of Rs 350 per kg. Shamji urged the authorities to enforce steps to test for a minimum of 6% piperine content in such imports if it is for extraction purpose. The Vietnam pepper has only 4 to 5 % of piperine, he said.",0
342,"PM-KISAN to provide multiple benefits to farmers: CEAThe average income of farmers in 2015-16 was about Rs 30,000 and, hence, Rs 6,000 would be 20 per cent.PTI|Feb 17, 2019, 12.12 PM ISTNEW DELHI: Farm income support scheme PM-KISAN will provide multiple benefits to farmers, including improving their credit worthiness, said Chief Economic Adviser K V Subramanian. The Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi Yojana (PM-KISAN) was announced in the Interim Budget 2019-20, under which Rs 6,000 will be given in three instalments to 12 crore small and marginal farmers holding cultivable land up to 2 hectare. Producer support in India is very low compared to the other countries and the scheme will help in supplementing that, he told PTI. ""Across countries, producer support for farmers are quite high. The recent OECD study which talks about producers support in India is quite low. ""This section is the one which will be feeding 125 crore mouths and you have a population which is growing at less than 1 per cent and food production is growing at greater than 3 per cent,"" he said. Therefore, Subramanian said, there will be surpluses leading to fall in prices impacting income of farmers. Moreover, he said, the reason farming is supported in a lot of countries is that the risk-return trade-off is bad in the sector. ""Therefore, this constituent required support. There is definitely a case for supporting in a way that does not create distortion,"" he said. The other important benefit of this scheme is in terms of making farmers credit worthy as financial institutions have assured cash flow for this vulnerable section, he said. The average income of farmers in 2015-16 was about Rs 30,000 and, hence, Rs 6,000 would be 20 per cent, Subramanian said. ""If you have assured cash flow, banker can collateralise that and lend to the farmer up to Rs 24,000 in a year. ""Three four times of a Rs 6,000 assured income can be given to farmers by using the microfinance. What is important is that this is an assured return which has not been done so far. This is something financial institutions can indeed use,"" he added. It will have multiple benefits as it starts from basic premise that you need to be supporting an important constituent of economy which is vulnerable, he said, adding that it is something which is important. Prime Minister Narendra Modi will formally launch the scheme at a farmers' rally in Gorakhpur, Uttar Pradesh, on February 24. The data uploaded on the PM-KISAN portal till February 24 will be considered for transfer of the first instalment at the launch event and the second instalment will be given from April 1.",0

346,"Private players allowed only in infrastructure: Rail MinistryThe Railway Ministry on Wednesday said it has so far allowed infrastructure related investments in the rail sector, which is consistent with the government policy.Reacting to reports on private investment in the rail sector, the ministry said investment in container business was only to the extent of ownership of rolling stock and provision of container services as distinct from operation of such trains, which would be carried out by Indian Railways.As per the government's industrial policy, only railway transport is reserved for the public sector. Rail transport is defined as operation of freight and passenger trains and does not include ownership of track, rolling stock and other related infrastructure, the ministry said in a statement.It also said foreign direct investment up to 100 per cent is permitted under the automatic route in railway infrastructure as long as train operations were not involved.",1
347,"Privatisation must cover the whole rail sector, not just the railwaysEvery indicator, not just safety-related ones, underlines the travails of Indian Railways (IR). An instant solution is also offered. Every monopoly is inefficient, especially a public sector one. Liberalise, privatise, corporatise. Isn’t that how railways were developed in India, through private sector initiatives in the 19th century? Let’s leave aside history, where, the private sector didn’t exactly smell of roses. What do we mean by privatisation and what do we mean by IR? There is an IR that owns infrastructure (tracks, signalling, rolling stock, stations) and there is an IR that runs trains. There is also an IR that runs schools and hospitals, but since this is a non-core function, let’s just assume, eventually, IR sheds that. By privatisation, we may either mean private entry, or selling IR’s equity.Most services on trains and stations (cleaning, catering and maintenance) are already privatised. There is little IR does departmentally. Wagons are produced by the private sector. So, increasingly, are coaches and locomotives. What most people mean by private entry is the private sector running trains. On this, will we contemplate locomotive drivers from the private sector and safety (not to be confused with security) handled by the private sector? That’s worth thinking about. On privately run trains, most people don’t know policy already allows that. Why don’t we see them? There have been private luxury trains. On mainstream trains, there are two reasons. First, there has to minor tweaking of legislation to permit the private sector to charge fares and those fares, after the regulator has been set up, have to be reasonable. Second, any train, public or private, requires a path, from point A to point B. Today, capacity constraints are such that it is impossible to provide that path, for both passenger and goods trains. Sure, after freight corridors, capacity constraints will ease a bit. But fundamentally, easing requires huge investments, which IR’s present financial woes don’t allow. If you want to run a private train from Jodhpur to Jaisalmer, I am sure IR will find you a path. However, that’s not a remunerative segment. The private sector will be interested in high-density corridors, where there are capacity issues. Eventually, when private trains take off, they will run in those high density corridors. Who runs trains elsewhere? Will there be something like a universal service obligation? As a final element in private entry, what about stations? Private management of stations is one thing, private development is another. Private development requires a revenue model. Without land for commercial real estate development (like Delhi and Mumbai airports), it won’t work. At best, given distribution of IR land, this might happen for around 15 stations and no more.Let’s turn to privatisation through selling IR’s equity. Everything isn’t like IRCTC, IRCON or IRFC. A major problem is lack of proper commercial accounting in IR. Before buying something, you need to know its worth. Today, this isn’t possible. With successful pilots in zones/divisions already undertaken, there is no reason why the entire IR system shouldn’t have proper commercial accounting in the next two years. After that, production units (for manufacturing rolling stock) can certainly be hived off. There is no convincing market failure argument for these. But on infrastructure interpreted as tracks, signalling and related matters, all railways have a historical evolution and models imported from elsewhere can’t be easily implanted. It is a vertically and horizontally integrated structure, notwithstanding initial independent and regional developments in 19th century. Therefore, unbundling and privatising this is an expensive and pointless proposition. Once you have taken away the infrastructure, in the form of something like an IR Infrastructure Corporation, and hived off production units and non-core functions, what is left in the IR bit that runs trains, especially after private entry? There is nothing left to privatise there.",0
348,"Rabi cereals production to fall by nearly 10%: NBHCThis coupled with the drought in some parts have impacted Rabi sowing and could aggravate the distress in the farm sector.By Jayashree BhosaleAccording to the first estimate of rabi production in 2018-19, National Bulk Handling Corporation (NBHC), rabi cereals production is expected to decline by 9.91%, while chana/gram is the most affected pulse seeing 9.92% fall in acreage. ""As per our study, the total rabi cereals production for the year 2018-19 is expected to be lower by 9.91 per cent to 115.49 Million MT and wheat is expected to show a decline in area by 2.54 per cent to 29.66 Million Ha and production by 4.99 per cent to 94.72 Million MT owing to scanty and inequitable distribution of rainfall in major growing areas,"" an NBHC release said. The northeast monsoon, between October and December, over the country had been “Substantially below Normal”. The cumulative rainfall in the country during the post-monsoon season i.e. 01st October 2018 to 31st December 2018 has been 44 per cent lower than LPA. Rainfall in the four broad geographical divisions of the country during the above period have been lower than LPA by 51 per cent each in Central India & East & North East India, 45 per cent in North West India and 36 per cent in South Peninsula. This coupled with the drought in some parts have impacted Rabi sowing and could aggravate the distress in the farm sector. The southwest monsoon was almost 22 per cent below normal in the Marathwada region of Maharashtra, while in north interior Karnataka, the deficit was almost 29 per cent and 37 per cent below normal in Rayalseema. In Maharashtra, Vidarbha reported 88 per cent post-monsoon rainfall deficiency, which is the highest in the state. Similarly, drought affected regions like Marathwada received 84 per cent less rainfall, followed by central Maharashtra at 64 per cent deficiency and Konkan and Goa at 56 per cent rainfall deficiency in the post-monsoon period. According to NBHC, rabi rice acreage is recorded lower by 14.17 per cent and its production is expected to decrease significantly by 28.91 per cent due to major rice-growing states West Bengal, Odisha, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh are lagging sowing area. Total coarse cereals are expected to fall by 6.9 per cent to 12.1 million MT in 2018-19. This is due to a fall in production of Jowar, maize and barley. Jowar has seen the biggest fall in sowing, with around 2.52 million hectares, a fall of 18.82 per cent over last year. Area sown under maize and barley fell by 5.67 per cent and 2.62 per cent, respectively. NBHC has maintained that the most affected is the cultivation of pulses, particularly gram or chana. The acreage under gram is down in major growing States of Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Karnataka, which is reeling a drought. The gram acreage has decrease by 9.92 per cent to 9.70 million hectares from 10.76 million hectares in last year. Overall, the pulses have shown decrease by 6.75 per cent and the production is expected at 14.48 Million MT despite kulthi acreage and production increase significantly by 29.84 per cent and 31.23 per cent respectively. Masoor production is estimated 1.76 per cent lower at 1.71 Million MT as against 1.74 during 2017-18. ""However, oilseeds are the only crop which managed to retain last year’s level in terms of acreage with less than one per cent increase. A surge in mustard cultivation in Rajasthan has been critical in taking the total oilseeds sowing area to about 8.04 million hectares, which was 0.71 per cent higher than that in 2017-18. Mustard acreage is expected to increase by 5.03 per cent at 7.02 million hectares likewise production is expected to increase by 4.46 per cent to 8.69 million MT. Groundnut, Sunflower and safflower production for 2018-19 has been estimated to be lower at 0.97 million MT.,"" observed NBHC in its estimate.",0
349,"Rail budget to signal road to reform, says minister Suresh PrabhuThe railway budget will signal the direction of long-term reforms needed to revamp the world's fourth-largest rail network, minister Suresh Prabhu said on Thursday. ""The budget will set the direction of long and difficult road of reform,"" Prabhu told state-run broadcaster DD News ahead of his budget presentation.All eyes will be on Prabhu on Thursday on whether he will raise passenger fare and freight rates in his maiden rail budget to boost the cash-crunched railways and include proposals for Make in India initiatives besides enhancing safety and security.Minister of state for railway Manoj Sinha had earlier ruled out a reduction in fares in the context of falling diesel rates but Prabhu is expected to make a tight rope walk as he tries to bridge the huge gap in finances while presenting the budget in Lok Sabha.Prabhu is likely to unravel his grand plans of how to decrease the cross-subsidy for passenger service from freight earnings which is touching Rs 24,000 crore and the steps to increase goods transportation share in the national transporter with or without hiking fares.India's decrepit state-run train services stand to receive at least a 25% boost in investment to over $9 billion, funded solely by falling fuel costs, according to officials familiar with the railway budget.The world's fourth largest rail network could get even more if Prime Minister Narendra Modi makes it a priority, as China did during its rapid economic growth over the past two decades.There are high hopes that his nine-month-old government will plough money into investment in infrastructure needed to haul the economy out of a rut when it presents its first annual federal budget on Saturday.The rail budget could show how far Modi's India is prepared to drive investment in a vital transport sector.""The fall in diesel prices and a pick-up in freight earnings have given us a golden chance to raise investments,"" said one government official.An increase in the budget allocation would go some way to offset disappointment at the lack of private sector interest in investing in railways, after Modi's government last year suggested public-private partnerships for new routes.",1
350,"Rail budget: There’s a lot riding on rail modernisationSuresh Prabhu covered a lot of ground in his railway budget setting out four goals, five drivers and 11 thrust areas for his ministry. First the good news: No new trains or projects were announced, which means that already crowded tracks will not be further burdened and we will see an improved punctuality of passenger and goods trains. The bad news is that he has shied away from hiking passenger fares which remain abysmally low at Rs 0.30 per km, lower than Delhi Metro’s fare of Rs 1 per km.Leading the 11 ‘thrust areas’ is ‘quality of journey’ for the passengers ranging from providing 17,000 bio-toilets in coaches to 650 new toilets at various stations. He has promised e-catering on 108 trains for passengers to get the food of their choice, apps for train bookings, improved access for the disabled, new helplines for women and the facility to purchase a ticket online in five minutes!He also proposed more satellite terminals to reduce overcrowding of existing ones, but has pinned his hopes on the PPP (Public Private Partnership) model which is a highly indeterminate option and could result in turning over Railways’ land to property dealers. Some new innovations include setting up electronic displays at 2000 major stations to show real time status of trains, of course with private participation which would lead to advertising, adding to the cacophony and noise pollution on platforms.Booking tickets 120 days in advance will undoubtedly help citizens to plan in advance, but a higher penalty for last minute cancellation of booking would have also helped to discourage touts who manage to block tickets during the busy festival season.Prabhu has placed great faith in union transport, highways and shipping minister Nitin Gadkari who would help him with providing rail connectivity to ports. For improving rail safety he has drawn heavily on the Anil Kakodkar report proposing the ATP (Automatic Train Protection) system which will be very expensive.Plans are afoot for roping in PSUs to partner the Railways in providing better connectivity to transport their raw material and finished products such as coal, steel and cement. Prabhu has claimed a good preliminary response but how much this will translate into reality remains to be seen.Businesses will welcome proposals for automatic fare rebate for loading wagons on (empty) return journeys. But the results could be mixed since matching consignments with availability of empty wagons will not be easy and could also result in higher wagon turnround affecting operational efficiency.Suresh has promised to build 970 RUBs (Road Under Bridge) and ROBs (Road Over Bridge) to eliminate unmanned level crossings that caused accidents.Setting up a Logistics Corporation will usher in an era of greater involvement by the Railways in multi-modal transport by setting up new facilities at hundreds of disused goods sheds. Undoubtedly partnering with major private logistics providers will be crucial for the success of the scheme.The only redeeming feature of this year’s rail budget is the fact that at last realisation has dawned on the powers that be, that populism has to give way to pragmatism for regaining the financial health of the nation’s economic life line and a crucial engine of growth!The size of the Plan Budget has gone up by 52% from Rs. 65,798 crore in 2014-15 to Rs 1,00,011 crore in 2015-16. Support from the central government constitutes 41.6% of the total Plan budget and internal generation 17.8%, perhaps the best financial indicator to ensure that the Railways will at last be moving on the right track.",1

We have to move merely providing rail infrastructure to other support services such as technology up gradation, better logistic support and better passenger services in an integrated manner,  said  Rajen Gohain, Minister of State for Railways, while inaugurating an ASSOCHAM conference on ‘ASSOCHAM International Summit on Invest Rail .’ “Need of the hour in Indian Railways is the massive investment and new technology without which we cannot move to become a world class transporter. Thus, the plan is to increase investment to nearly one trillion rupees in the next decade”, said Mr Rajen Gohain. Thus, Rail is the right forum for investment that can address nearly all investments challenges such as ensuring reduced global warming, volatile fuel costs, having lower energy consumption, reducing urban congestion, having less land usage, servicing an aging population and making transportation accessible to all ages across all income brackets. In addition, rail has lower infrastructure renewal and maintenance cost which is often mentioned as 20 times lower per ton kilometre that other forms. “Investment in rail will thus help in the planets sustainable and environmental goals and help in meeting the greenhouse gas emission targets. In addition, rail offers a more stable and sustainable form of transportation. We, in Indian Railways, are thus trying to have a collaborative approach in bringing governments, local authorities, railways and other stakeholders on the same wave length for a more sustainable form of transport system”, mentioned Mr. Gohain. Investing in rail stimulates the economy while reducing CO2 emissions and urban congestion. As many countries worldwide plan to step up their investments in rail over the next decade, we in Indian Railways can and must do more. While India has the world’s fourth largest rail network, it has been outstripped by /china, which now has more than six times as much track following an intensive expansion and modernisation of its network over the past two decades. We are thus also looking in using PPP more- or as articulated in the coming years. We aim to keep people at the centre of all our activities and investments in our journey, said Railway Minister. Indian Railways has one of the biggest network in the world and is recognised as one of the largest organisation under single management. It is also an admitted fact that for the past couple of centuries, transportation has fuelled the world’s economy. In this context, for the country’s economic and environmental health, it is thus time to restore the balance between road, air and rail. Others who also spoke during the conference were H.E.

The allies of main political party used to demand the railway ministry to join the government. The party which came to power at Centre also used the railway ministry as a bargaining tool to distribute trophies to its allies. This is a bitter truth,"" he said. ""Leaders from political parties who got the control of the railways were not interested in (development of) railways and I need not say what they were interested in,"" Modi said.The Prime Minister today laid the foundation stone for redevelopment of Gandhinagar railway station, which will get a face-lift at a cost of Rs 250 crore and will have a 300-room five star hotel built atop.""My government has given priority to railways... it should expand, it should be developed, get modernised and it should bring a qualitative change in the lives of common people.”""We have tried to do this in the last two years and five months. We have increased the budget of railways to double of what it was,"" he said.Modi listed various works done by his government to develop railways and said the pace of doubling of railway tracks has increased, besides speeding up of gauge conversion and electrification of lines. He said free WiFi has been provided at railway stations.The Central government is working to increase speed of trains and also striving to bring in global technology to make railways safer, as ""safety is of greatest concern"", Modi said.""In developed countries, 70 per cent goods transportation is carried out by railways while rest by roads. However in India, 15 to 20 per cent is through railways while 70 to 80 per cent is by roads. Goods tend to get costlier when transported by roads. We are stressing on development of freight corridors,"" he said.The Prime Minister also said that railway stations located in cities can be developed by constructing high-rise buildings atop them.Gandhiangar railway station will be redeveloped through a special purpose vehicle (SPV) formed between the Gujarat government and the Indian Railway Stations Development Corporation Ltd (IRSDC). The proposed name of the SPV is Gandhinagar Railway & Development Corporation Ltd.The project includes redevelopment of the railway station as well as the construction of a 300-room five star hotel atop the station. The hotel, with three towers, will be around 65 metres tall.Railway Minister Suresh Prabhu said his ministry is planning to replicate such redevelopment at 23 railway stations across the country.",1
362,"Railways agents misused demonetisation waivers: CAGIn November 2016, 132 Indian Railways’ Jansadharan Ticket Booking Sewaks (JTBS) took unfair advantage of a three-day-long waiver facility provided by the government to allow transactions at railway ticketing counters after the shock demonetisation order of November 8, and deposited unusually big quantities of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 currency notes on the three subsequent days, a CAG report has found out.The 132 JTBS were from the Central, Eastern, Northeast Frontier, North Eastern, North Western and Western Railway (CR, ER, NFR, NER, NWR and WR) zones. On November 9, 2016, the Railway Board, had issued a directive that the Rs500 and Rs 1,000 bank notes would not cease to be legal tender from November 9, 2016 until November 11, 2016, to the extent of transactions at railway ticketing counters for purchase of tickets, for which complete records were required to be maintained.The CAG report said: “Audit test checked the transactions carried out by 132 JTBSs during 07 November 2016 to 11 November 2016 on 59 stations of six Zonal Railways. A comparison of deposits made by the JTBSs for five days of pre and post demonetisation revealed that post demonetization, total cash deposited by these 132 JTBSs exceeded their normal pre-demonetization cash deposit by significant amounts…”The national auditor observed — “No specific directives/instructions were issued by the Railway Board in respect of cash deposited by the JTBSs in Railway’s Deposit Accounts essential for issue/sale of unreserved tickets through computerised Unreserved Ticketing System. 132 JTBS in six Zonal Railways took undue advantage of the facility provided by the Government of India to allow transactions at railway ticketing counters and deposited specified bank notes with the Railways post demonetisation instead of depositing the cash in the banks”.Started in 2008 in order to cut down long queues at railway stations, the JTBS scheme permits an individual to sell railway tickets outside railway stations. The JTBS charges Rs 1 per ticket but can sell only unreserved tickets and cannot issue concession tickets. ",1
363,"Railways begin work on export policyIndian Railways is working on an export policy under which top officials from the country’s coach factories will be able to visit other countries to seek bulk orders for train coaches. The absence of an export policy has impeded the ability of state-run factories to seek regular overseas orders, after executing the last order for coaches, from Sri Lanka, in 2010-12.The railways is looking at Southeast Asia, the Middle East and Africa for potential customers under the proposed policy, seeking alternative sources of revenue by capitalising on the cost advantage offered by its coach factories, which build train cars up to a fifth cheaper than overseas competitors. The policy will empower officials of the rank of general managers and above to take decisions and sew up deals quickly.“Manufacturing coaches is one part where we have good capacity and we can maintain international standards as well. Also, the cost per coach will be 20-25% less than what is there in other parts of the world. If a policy is in place, we will be able to take frequent orders and our officials won’t have to take approval for every decision. They will be free to take decisions,” said Rajesh Aggarwal, member (rolling stock) of the Railway Board.Aggarwal said that even to travel abroad, an official now needs to seek approval from the railway ministry and Railway Board.“We have been doing exports through RITES, but with export policies, we will be able to take direct orders,” Railway board chairman Ashwani Lohani said. RITES is a state-run consulting company that specialises in transport infrastructure.Railways recently exported the first set of Diesel Electric Multiple Units to Sri Lanka from Integral Coach Factory (ICF) in Chennai. ICF has exported coaches and coach components to various countries like Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan, Vietnam, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Tanzania, Mozambique, Angola, Nigeria and Uganda.“ICF is expecting another order from Sri Lanka railways for export of 160 coaches and the modalities are being worked out along with RITES Ltd. Advanced levels of negotiations are going on between Indian Railways and Bangladesh Railways for export of coaches from ICF,” said S Mani, general manager of ICF.Railway is prepared to manufacture both standard and meter gauge coaches and Modern Coach Factory at Raebareli in Uttar Pradesh is being expanded to increase capacity.“The capacity of coach factory in Indian Railway is good and underdeveloped countries can be a good market for India. But quality should be maintained in order to get good revenue,” said RK Singh, former chairman of the Railway Board.",1

366,"Railways Minister flying high on taxpayers moneyUnion Ministers are busy people, and perennially unsure of their schedule. Or so it would seem from the considerable bill run up by the Union Railways Minister on charter planes and multiple bookings.As part of a series on the misuse of public funds by various ministries of the government of India, an investigation into the workings of the Railways Ministry reveals that rail officials frequently have bent rules to provide charter planes to Union Railways Minister Piyush Goyal since he got the portfolio in September 2017. This has cost the public exchequer 15-20 times more than what it would have cost for the minister to board regular planes.A Railways rule underlines that the Railways can hire a charter plane or helicopter only in case of railway accidents. A minister cannot hire a charter plane for official business unless he is inspecting an accident site.It is also worth noting that Narendra Modi had invoked austerity measures soon after his swearing-in as Prime Minister in 2014. The rulebook states that all government officials including ministers have to fly Air India unless flights are not available in emergency situations. However, Railways officials let Piyush Goyal and his two junior ministers in the Railways, take private airlines instead of Air India.In addition to this, the Minister’s office buys two to three air tickets for the same destination on a given day just to ensure that Goyal doesn’t miss his flight. This expense is paid by the Railways, so essentially it is at the expense of Indian taxpayers.In September 2017, within days of swearing-in as Union Railways Minister, Piyush Goyal’s office put out a request for hiring a charter plane to travel from Delhi to Surat and later Mumbai. In response to the request for hiring a charter plane, Additional General Manager, Northern Railways Manju Gupta wrote to the Railways Board: “The Schedule of Powers, vide para 58 of Part-A (Powers of General Manager), empowers the GM/DRMs to requisition helicopter/aeroplane to reach the site of serious accident for rescue operations expeditiously and to evacuate injured and dead in the event of serious accident. No such powers for hiring/booking chartered flight/helicopter for Hon’ble MR (Minister of Railway) have been given therein.’’Newslaundry has accessed this letter. The letter also states that the Railways Board should put appropriate norms in place since “such demands [for charter flights] may arise’’ in future. The letter proposes that the Railways Board should depute a Railways Public Sector Unit (PSU) to hire charter planes if need be. After receiving the letter, the Railways Board without wasting any time appointed Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation (IRCTC) to hire charter planes for the Minister.Goyal, however, later dropped his Surat travel plan. It is unclear how the Railways Board could appoint the IRCTC to overrule a central government circular. Later, as per Railways records accessed by Newslaundry, IRCTC did book charter planes for Piyush on at least three occasions.Records show that Goyal first flew along with his wife Seema Goyal and his private secretary to Mumbai-Belgaum-Delhi on a three-day trip (February 9-11, 2018), which cost Rs 13 lakh. His second charter flight to Shani Shingnapur-Shirdi-Tulapur (pilgrimage places known for their temples) and later to Latur on April 2 cost Rs 25.50 lakh. This trip coincided with a bhoomi poojan of a coach factory he attended at Latur. And on June 2, he travelled from Delhi to Jodhpur and then back to Delhi on a charter plane, costing over Rs 10 lakh.Goyal’s charter plane seems to have incurred more expenses towards waiting rather than flying if one is to go by the three-day Belgaum schedule put out by his office. A charter plane takes anything between Rs 2 lakh and Rs 3 lakh per hour as waiting charge.According to the schedule, he arrived at Belgaum at 10:00 am on February 10. The charter plane remained parked till 8.15 pm on February 11, and then it took off to Delhi, his final destination. And when the plane was parked, the minister travelled by road to inspect a site of road over-bridge, paid tribute to Mahatma Gandhi at Belagavi railway station, inaugurated UTS Mobile ticketing App over South Western Railways Zone from Belagavi railway station and works to the facelift of the station building.Piyush Goyal also interacted with industrialists and members of Chamber of Commerce. The function went on for an hour to get members’ views on the forthcoming annual budget and Railways infrastructure.It would have cost Goyal less than Rs 50,000 if he had taken a routine return flight to Belgaum, assuming he was travelling by business class. But a charter plane cost taxpayers nearly Rs 13 lakh. The minister inaugurated a Railways App and discussed the budget with businessmen. Again, it should be remembered that the minister is not entitled to charter planes unless he is inspecting an accident site.During his charter flight to Latur in April, Goyal first went to pay homage to deities. “I’m fortunate to have darshan of Shani mandir in Shani Shingnapur this morning; I took blessings of Sai Baba at Shirdi and then went to Tuljapur to take blessings of Maa Bhawani before coming to Latur,’’ he was later quoted saying in his speech. Piyush did bhoomi pujan of a coach factory at Latur and wound up the tour. The chartered flight alone cost the exchequer Rs 25.50 lakh.Piyush and his family visited Shani Shingnapur in the past too. According to his website, he had visited Shani Shingnapur on October 26, 2016, along with his wife and son Dhruv.Moreover, one of his latest trips by a special plane was to Jodhpur, where he flagged off Humsafar Jodhpur-Bandra Express. This cost taxpayers a little over Rs 10 lakh.",1

369,"Railways, Urban Development Ministries To Redevelop Stations Under Smart City PlansIn a major initiative, railway stations and adjoining areas will be redeveloped on Smart City lines for enhancing passenger amenities, easy access to stations, enabling optimal utilization of land at railway stations, as a part of Smart City development. A Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was signed in this regard by the Ministries of Urban Development and Railways in the presence of Shri M.Venkaiah Naidu and Shri Suresh Prabhu. Dr.Sameer Sharma, Mission Director, Smart City Mission and Shri Rajiv Chaudhary, Advisor, Ministry of Railways signed the MoU. Both the Ministers lauded the joint initiative as a historic landmark that brings synergy in development of smart cities since there can’t be a smart city without a smart railway station. M.Venkaiah Naidu said on the occasion that this convergence based city development will result in qualitative improvement in city life. He suggested involvement of local people in redevelopment plans. Naidu suggested that to begin with 10 cities could be taken up for the proposed redevelopment with the involvement of National Buildings Construction Corporation(NBCC) which has successfully executed redevelopment projects on self-financing basis. These cities are : Sarai Rohilla (Delhi), Bhubaneswwar, Lucknow, Varnasi, Jaipur, Kota, Thane, Margao(Goa), Tirupati and Puducherry. This was agreed to by Railway Minister. Minister of Railways Suresh Prabhu said that railway stations have been the core of city development and have become congested over time and their redevelopment offers immense opportunities for changing city landscape. Stating that redevelopment work of Habibganj railway station has already been awarded and plans for Anand Vihar (Delhi), Surat, Bijwasan and Gandhinagar are in advanced stage. He said that several countries like Germany, France, Japan, South Korea, UK and Belgium have showed interest in redevelopment and a Round Table of domestic and overseas bankers will be organized next week to discuss financing of these redevelopment projects. To be implemented first in the 100 cities included in the Smart City Mission, redevelopment of railway stations will be undertaken in AMRUT (Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation) and HRIDAY (Heritage Infrastructure Development and Augmentation Yojana) cities extending the scope of the MoU to over 500 cities. Railway station and the adjoining area in each of these cities will be redeveloped on the lines of Area Based Development provided in the Smart City Mission Guidelines. Average cost of redevelopment of identified area of about 500 acres in the Smart City Plans of 60 cities approved so far comes to about Rs.1,500 cr. The proposed redevelopment involving railway stations envisages improving passenger amenities, easy access to stations, integrated public transport hub, waiting halls and other amenities for passengers, development of residential and commercial spaces, land scaping etc. The joint initiative of the Ministries of Urban Development and Railways widens the smart city development to one more area in each of the mission cities with each city required to select one area under respective Smart City Plans in the first phase. The MoU proposes two Joint Venture options for speedy redevelopment of railway station centred areas. The first being between the Railways and the Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) formed for execution of Smart City Plans, with equal share in equity. In the second model, National Buildings Construction Corporation (NBCC) can be roped in with equal share among the three. NBCC can design, develop and execute the redevelopment plans on self-financing basis. While the Ministry of Railways takes the responsibility of forming Joint Ventures, the Ministry of Urban Development will work with the States and Urban Local Bodies for integrating railway station redevelopment as part of smart city development plans. MoU states that ‘Both railway station redevelopment and Smart City concepts are part of holistic development of respective city. Redevelopment of railway station and its suburbs as part of Smart City Plans leads to an integrated public transport hub around railway station and encourage Transit Oriented Development.” The validity of the MoU is five years to begin with and can be extended with the consent of both the Ministries. Smart City Plans of some cities have already included area based development surrounding railway stations. These include; Bhubaneswar, Thane and Solapur (Maharashtra), Kakinada (Andhra Pradesh), Ahmedabad, Ajmer, Hubli-Dharwad (Karnataka). Smart City Plans of some other cities may potentially impact city railway station and allied services. These include; Jaipur, Kochi, Jabalpur, Visakhapatnam, Indore, Pune, Bhopal, Chennai etc.",0

Of the 54 consequential train accidents in 2017 (between April 1 and December 15), five were reported from ECR.Rescue and relief works in progress after the nine coaches of Delhi-bound Seemanchal Express derailed at Sahadai Buzurg station in Vaishali district, Hajipur on February 3.(PTI Photo)East Central Zone of the Indian Railways, where 11 coaches of the Seemanchal Express (Jogbani-Anand Vihar) derailed on Sunday, is notorious for accidents.In a safety review in December, it emerged as the second-worst zone (of the total 18) in terms of consequential train accidents followed by the Northern Railway. It recorded five such incidents between April 1, 2018 and December 15, 2018. Northern Railway reported eight such incidents during the period. The total number stood at 45.The Indian Railways has adopted a “Zero Accident” policy, and the number of passengers killed in various railway accidents was lowest in 2017-18 (57). But deaths caused by derailments make experts worried. The Railways categorises accidents the following categories: collision, derailment, mishaps at manned level crossings, mishaps at unmanned level crossings and fire.“Bulk of railways’ money goes to staff cost and fuel...there is little left for the maintenance. Derailment of a passenger train is a major embarrassment for the railways, and they must do track maintenance on priority. The zone where the accident has taken used to be called the sleeping division, as efforts to improve tracks were less. This accident is a symptom that tracks and coaching maintenance are faulty and need to be fixed,” said Sri Prakash, who retired as member (traffic) of the Indian Railways in 2009.The East Central Railway comprises Dhanbad, Mughal Sarai, Samastipur and Danapur divisions.

371,"Rain, hailstorm damage mustard, vegetable crops; wheat largely unaffectedWhile the rains will help cut the cost of irrigation for the wheat crop, these are set to affect the output of oilseeds.By Parshant Krar, ET Bureau |Feb 09, 2019, 09.11 PM ISTCHANDIGARH: Heavy rains and hailstorms that lashed north-western India on Thursday have caused damage to oilseeds and other easily perishable crops, mainly peas, potato and cauliflower, in the region. But the main rabi crop of wheat may have scraped through the inclement weather. While the rains will help cut the cost of irrigationNSE -1.73 % for the wheat crop, these are set to affect the output of oilseeds. “Mustard is affected by heavy rains as well as strong gust in several district ,” a senior official at the Haryana agriculture department said. Growers of peas, potato and cauliflower have suffered heavy losses as their crops are affected by the hailstorm. While mustard has taken a hit in Haryana, the weather has damaged the potato crop in Punjab. Wheat is expected to gain from the precipitation, though there could be a marginal yield loss in hailstorm-affected areas. As the wheat crop has not attained height, the wind and rain have not affected it,” an official of Punjab’s agriculture department said, adding: “But hailstorm has affected all the crops.” Officials, however, have alerted farmers about the risk of yellow rust that dwells in wet weather. Hailstorm and strong winds have caused damage in several pockets in districts of Sirsa, Hisar, Mahendergarh, Palwal, Bhiwani Kaithal and Gurgaon in Haryana. The Haryana government has decided to conduct survey of damage to crops In Punjab, initial reports indicate crop losses in Patiala, Ludhiana, Fatehgarh Sahib, Hoshiarpur, Mohali and Ferozepur. “There are preliminary reports of damage to crops, mainly perishables, but it will take a few days for the assessment of the extent of loss,” Punjab’s principal secretary of agriculture, KS Pannu, said.

375,"Rice Exports to gather steam on US, West Asia demand boostRice exports from India are set to swing in the last quarter of this year on a spate in orders after shipments slumped 14% in the last three quarters over high input costs and tepid demand from Bangladesh.By Parshant KrarChandigarh: Rice exports from India are set to swing in the last quarter of this year on a spate in orders after shipments slumped 14% in the last three quarters over high input costs and tepid demand from Bangladesh. “Consignments in January are better than the previous year and the trade is likely to attain levels close to the previous year,” a senior commerce and industry ministry official told ET. Exporters have seen a surge in demand from the United Arab Emirates, Iran, Saudi Arabia and the US this quarter. The official said the supply for exports has streamlined after being affected for the last few months of 2018 because of assembly polls in some states. A bumper yield in Bangladesh also took toll on Indian exports, he said. The 5% subsidy on export value extended to non-basmati rice under the Merchandise Exports from India Scheme (MEIS) in November helped in recovery of trade , but margins remained thin, exporters said. “Raw material (paddy) prices are still high as most farmers are inclined to sell to the state agencies in states, including Chhattisgarh,” said P Baskara Reddy, promoter of Kakinada-based Sri Chitra Agri Exports. He said the exporters hope that the scheme will be extended beyond March 26 and the incentive doubled to 10% under MEIS to complement the shrinking margins. The announcement of higher price assistance by political parties just ahead of the harvesting season in the run-up to the assembly polls had spiked government procurement and dampened private purchase in states like Chhattisgarh where the procurement price was higher by 60%. The non-basmati rice exports that are dependent largely on varieties grown in Chhattisgarh were affected as paddy supply dried up following announcement of higher than minimum support price (MSP). Exporters are wary of such politically motivated price assistance. “Higher procurement price will subdue trade in the coming years. Direct financial assistance is a better route to support farmers,” Rice Exporters’ Association president BV Krishan Rao said. Higher procurement would lead to a surplus buffer stock and a situation where the government will have to auction its stocks at a loss, he said. “Similar situation took place in 1999-2000 when Food Corporation of India had to release its brimming stocks at a discount after higher MSP had boosted federal procurement three-times over the buffer stock norms,” Rao said. The rice procurement crossed 41 lakh tonnes so far compared to 32.5 lakh tonnes in Chhattisgarh in the last Kharif marketing season. “We have not taken export commitments this season as farmers are keen to sell to government agencies,” a senior executive of Uttar Pradesh-based Laxmi Rice Mills said. While export of basmati rice has increased till December, non-basmati exports stayed downhill with 5.6 million tonnes of shipment till December as against 6.3 MT a year ago.",0

The two pilots, Squadron Leader Samir Abrol and Squadron Leader Siddhartha Negi, died on the spot.The arresters installed at HAL airport are expected to stop aircraft that weigh up to 30 tonnes travelling at speeds of up to 160-170 knots. The Mirage 2000 trainer weighs much less, 13-14 tonnes, and was travelling at a speed of less than 160 knots, the officials added.Abrol and Negi were on an “acceptance sortie” of the Mirage 2000 trainer aircraft after it was overhauled by the Bengaluru-based, state-owned company. The sortie was taking place on the HAL runway in Yemalur in Bengaluru on February 1.An HAL spokesperson declined comment. An Indian Air Force (IAF) spokesperson, too, declined comment because of the ongoing court of inquiry into the accident.Read more| ‘My son loved to fly Mirage 2000’, says father of IAF officer killed in crash in BengaluruThe accident occurred a day after IAF chief Air Chief Marshal BS Dhanoa criticised HAL, and also pointed to the number of pilots who lost their lives testing the state-owned firm’s indigenously developed aircraft.According to the officials, the number of times major snags have been detected by IAF at the time of delivery in an aircraft overhauled or manufactured by HAL is high. For instance, last June, an Su-30 was on an acceptance sortie (its 13th) when it crashed near Nashik. The pilot and the flight engineer ejected successfully. These sorties are done by IAF only after HAL has flown the aircraft a certain number of times and cleared them for acceptance.In 2018-2019, the Russian designed Su-30Mki – the mainstay fighter of the IAF – manufactured by HAL required as many as six sorties as against the designated two sorties before they could be accepted. “The increased number of sorties is because snags were found,” a second senior government official said.Read more | Outdated jets for IAF, cheese & wine for babus: Pilot’s brother pens poemSimilarly, Mirage 2000 aircraft overhauled by HAL have, on average, required two sorties more than the mandatory number because of snags. And, Jaguars, the British made deep-strike bombers that are overhauled by HAL, have required, on average, three sorties more than the two sorties designated for acceptance. For the advanced light helicopters (ALH), flown by the Indian Army, Navy and Air Force, and also made by HAL, the numbers are equally bad.“Every aircraft needs to go through a certain number of sorties testing various test points before it can be accepted by IAF for deployment. The fact that the more sorties are having to be flown to rectify the snags indicates either the process of testing is not being done properly by the manufacturer or the process lacks rigorousness at the HAL end,” said Air Marshal SBP Sinha (retd), who till recently was the Air Officer Commanding at the Central Air Command of IAF.Arrester barriers are installed at the end of the runway to deal with exactly the kind of situation the overhauled Mirage 2000 trainer was facing. They are meant to stop an aircraft that has either aborted take-off or made an emergency landing from overshooting the runway with minimal damage to aircraft or injury to the crew.In this case, the Mirage 2000 trainer came down seconds after take-off. The undercarriage of the aircraft was sheared off, most likely because of the impact. And the arrester barrier was the only way that the two test pilots could have brought the aircraft to a stop.The black box of the fighter has been sent to France for a detailed analysis to assist the Court of Inquiry (CoI) that is investigating the crash. “Separately, inquiries are also being conducted on why the arrester barrier gave way,” said a senior HAL official who asked not to be named.",0

378,"Scrap free pass for rail employees’Railway activists on Sunday demanded that perks like free suburban passes for railway employees as well as their families be taken away from both Central and Western railway employees, to save more time and money.They were reacting to the Central Railway’s proposal of limiting the validity of return tickets to six hours. Subhash Gupta from Rail Pravasi Sangh and also a member of CR’s Divisional Railway Users Consultative Committee (DRUCC) said, “Officials said that the idea was proposed to save time and, on the other hand, the railway employees are issued passes that can be used for unlimited number of journeys for free.”A railway official revealed on the condition of anonymity that around 3.5 lakh railway employees and family members avail of this facility in Central Railway’s (CR) head office at CST and Western Railway’s (WR) at Mumbai Central.“The railway passes is resulting in a loss of approximately Rs 7 to Rs 7.5 crore yearly as a result of this facility to its employees,” said the official.The passes include both second and first class but most of the passes get issued for first class,” he further added.Mr Gupta said the railway city officials should discuss the proposal and the passes with the unions.“It is in common knowledge that free passes are not given to not only to the employees but also to the immediate family and it is a burden that the Mumbai railway can no longer bear” he said.“The railway employees should at least get together with the union and discuss the issue,” he further added.",1
379,"Send a message: Pakistan’s weakest pressure points are financial rather than militaryIndia can work with the US, EU and other major powers to impose tough sanctions on Pakistan’s military-ISI elite which drives its security policies and much else in the country.TNN|Feb 25, 2019, 11.16 AM ISTFollowing the Pulwama terror attack Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan claimed he needed “actionable intelligence” on Jaish-e-Muhammed’s (JeM) role, despite the terror outfit itself claiming responsibility for the attack. Since then, the Pakistani Punjab government has moved to take control of the seminaries in Bahawalpur, thought to be JeM’s headquarters. But information minister Fawad Chaudhry claiming these are purely religious madrasas, with no connection to JeM, showed Islamabad up to its usual game of making token gestures whenever international heat is cranked up on it. It does indicate an area of vulnerability, though, which is worth building upon if New Delhi is to inflict a high cost on Pakistan for harbouring terror safe havens. Military strikes are difficult at this point since the element of surprise is gone; moreover terror facilities such as Bahawalpur are likely to have been evacuated by now. But Pakistan is short of foreign currency; indeed its policy of nurturing terror creates chronic internal instability which prevents it from having a viable usual game of making token gestures whenever international heat is cranked up on it. Giving proof to Pakistan on terror activities from its soil has been proven to be pointless by now, but lobbying international agencies has had some success. The UN Security Council has, for the first time, condemned a terror strike in Kashmir and blamed JeM for it. New Delhi must strongly lobby international financial agencies such as IMF or FATF to blacklist Pakistan and deny it financial bailouts, till such time as it can roll up its terror infrastructure. This also serves US interests, as it can roll up its terror infrastructure. This also serves US interests, as it would like to see a stable Afghanistan when it leaves. New Delhi and Washington should work closely together on this. India can, in addition, work with the US, EU and other major powers to impose tough sanctions on Pakistan’s military-ISI elite which drives its security policies and much else in the country. Such sanctions would quickly bring Pakistan around, and the argument for them can be reinforced by putting the international community on notice that further terror outrages such as 26/11 or Pulwama will lead to an automatic military response from India, as India has the right to defend itself and domestic public opinion will not stand for anything less.",0

All the seven persons — four men, two women and an eight-year-old girl — died on the spot. Six of the deceased were in the ambulance while one was travelling in the car, police said.“The ambulance was going from Jammu to Patna and carrying the body of one Zakir Ansari. The driver, Hari Singh from Jammu, was killed in the accident,” said SP Sharma, in-charge of Baldeo police station in Mathura.Police have been able to identify five of the deceased. These included Jehangir Alam 36, Mohd Tahir Ansari, 32, Suhail Ahmad, 30, and ambulance driver Hari Singh, police said.“Those in the car on the other side of divider were from Tundla town in Firozabad.

381,"Smriti Irani in Amethi ahead of PM’s visit, accuses Rahul Gandhi of lyingAhead of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to Amethi on March 3, union textile minister Smriti Irani on Sunday reached the Congress bastion to launch a scathing attack on local MP and Congress president Rahul Gandhi.Her Amethi visit was timed with the launch of the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN) Scheme by the PM in Gorakhpur on Sunday.Distributing Kisan Samman Nidhi certificates to 25 farmers from Amethi in a symbolic launch of cash transfer scheme during a programme at Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya in Gauriganj, Irani repeatedly accused Gandhi of “lying”.Hailing the PM-KISAN Scheme, she said it would benefit 3.80 lakh farmers of Amethi alone. Modi had last visited Amethi on the final day of the 2014 Lok Sabha poll campaign, a visit which political experts believe helped Irani put up an impressive fight against Gandhi in just about 20 days.She had brought down Gandhi’s victory margin to one lakh votes in 2014, down from 3 lakh in 2009. Irani is widely tipped to re-contest against Congress chief Rahul Gandhi in the 2019 LS polls.“Five years back, Narendra Modiji had promised development. He has honoured his promise even as Amethi’s ‘naamdaar’ family only sold dreams to you,” she said after listening to Modi’s radio show ‘Mann ki Baat’.Accusing Gandhi of never raising the issue of “Amethi’s development” in Lok Sabha, she said: “Your local MP never cared about the development of Amethi but about 1.40 lakh people in Amethi benefited through Modi government’s Ujjawala scheme and another 1.25 lakh got the benefits of Ayushman Bharat Scheme which provides illness cover of up to Rs 5 lakh per annum to each poor household.”“The Modi government gave you ‘izzat ghar’ (toilets). In record time, the Yogi Adityanath government in UP has identified poor farmers who would benefit under the Kisan Samman Nidhi,” she said, stressing that only the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) could develop Amethi.She said the Modi government honoured 12 farmers with Padma awards.Irani inspected the venue where the PM would address the people of Amethi and also met BJP leaders who have been tasked with ensuring a good turnout for Modi’s rally.Both the Samajwadi Party (SP) and the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) have decided against fielding a candidate from Amethi and Rae Bareli in 2019 LS polls – a decision likely to benefit the Congress.",0

383,"Spontaneous rail roko hits Central RailwayA technical snag at the level crossing at Bhivpuri railway station triggered commuter unrest at Badlapur Friday early morning.Hundreds of angry commuters gathered on platforms and railway tracks to stage a “rail roko” for nearly six hours, from 5.05 am till such time the protest was called off after a written assurance from the stationmaster. Meanwhile, Amitabh Ojha, divisional railway manager (DRM), held commuters responsible and said he would find out the anti-social elements responsible for fanning the agitation. A CST-bound local got delayed owing to signal failure at Bhivpuri which sparked off the protest. What started as an argument between commuters and the stationmaster turned into a full-blown rail roko. “At first, there were only four railway police present at the station but when commuters stepped in front of the train to stop it and did not budge for half-an-hour, we deployed around 160 personnel on an emergency basis. We were afraid it would escalate into a Diva-like situation,” said an official on condition of anonymity. Initially, a handful of commuters started protesting irregular rail services on Central Railway (CR) but soon, hundreds of commuters, who face the same plight every day, joined in.Passengers stopped all trains plying into and out of the station and shouted slogans against CR. They were in no mood to listen to the railway police or commuters’ association or pravasi sanghatana. Finally, railway minister Suresh Prabhu had to intervene and request commuters to end their agitation.Following Mr Prabhu’s tweet, Mr Ojha reached Badlapur around 10 am and held a meeting with railway officials and the railway police. City police too attended the meeting. The police then tried to get commuters off the railway tracks but in vain. At about 10.40 am, the stationmaster assured commuters that local trains would run on time and would not be delayed. He urged them to stop agitating and allow trains to move.Only after a written assurance from him did commuters call off the protest, and the first train of the day which had been stopped at Badlapur since 5.05 am, started its journey at 10.52 am.By end of the day, CR saw more than 50 services cancelled and more than 65 trains delayed. ""We are expecting even bigger numbers by end of the day. The Kalyan-Thane section had no trains, and we began to run special trains between Ambernath and CSTM/Kalyan, Vangani and Karjat, and Khopoli,"" said another official on condition of anonymity.After train services resumed, Mr Ojha, while speaking with media persons, said that some anti-social elements were behind the protest. ""We are trying to find the people who started the protest at the railway station early morning. We suspect they were not regular commuters but probably some anti-social elements and we will trace them,"" he said. However, no complaint against unknown persons was filed with the railway police till evening.Advocate R.S. Godbole, adviser to pravasi sanghatana, said that the population of Badlapur had increased over the past five years as most people from Mumbai had shifted to Badlapur owing to low-cost housing and clean atmosphere. However, CR had not increased its services proportionately.""There's always a heavy rush of Pune-bound commuters. We need a third and fourth dedicated lane for express trains from Kalyan to Karjat. But the railway board has ignored our demands. Friday's incident is nothing but commuters' pent-up anger that finally exploded. If the issues are not sorted out, what happened at Diva could well be repeated at Badlapur,"" warned Advocate Godbole.Meanwhile, with over 21 local train ferries affected since morning and trains running from CST to Ambernath, most commuters travelled to Ambernath by taking an auto-rickshaw from Badlapur station.Sensing an opportunity, rickshaw-wallahs charged passengers Rs 200 instead of the usual Rs 20 for the Badlapur-Ambernath commute. Kalyan Dombivali Municipal Transport provided five city buses for the Kalyan-Badlapur ferry.",1

The announcement comes just ahead of the Lok Sabha poll dates being declared. As part of the agreement, the Railway Board will give 650 acres of its land at Re 1 per acre, and in turn, the Karnataka government will bear partial costs of doubling two lines, estimated to cost Rs 1,700 crore.In a joint press conference alongside Kumaraswamy, Goyal said the long-awaited rail network connecting 82 stations spread over 160 km costing Rs 23,000 crore will be completed in six years.Goyal said, “The ‘19’ conditions subject to which ‘in principle’ approval was given by Karnataka state cabinet will be ratified, as mutually agreed during the meeting today.”The CM also assured, “In next cabinet meeting of Government of Karnataka scheduled to be held on February 25, cabinet resolution will be passed on the same. GO to that extent will be communicated to Ministry of Railways for further taking up the project.”A statement from the Indian Railways further stated, “Minister of Railways agreed for granting railway land for the project at very nominal lease basis of Re.1 per acre, which will reduce the cost of project by about Rs.6700 crores, nearly by 30 %. Government of Karnataka agreed for unequivocal right of FSI ‘5’ on railway land to Indian Railway for financing of project.Government of Karnataka will approve the entire corridor without any curtailment. It is also agreed by Government of Karnataka will do cost sharing of two doubling projects Baiyyappanahalli-Hosur, Yesvantpur-Banaswadi-Hosur which was initially agreed and later disagreed upon by State Government.”As part of this project, the Kempegowda International Airport will also be connected to the city via the suburban rail system. Out of the 83 stations, 12 including Majestic will have intermodal connectivity with the Bengaluru Metro. The announcement comes after days of disagreement between the state and Centre over the cost sharing of the project. The Ministry of Railways had also expressed surprise at Karnataka increasing the length of the rail project to 360 km without prior intimation.The announcement was awaited as the Karnataka Chief Minister gave an in-principal nod to the project based on a  pre-feasibility report readied by the Rail India Technical and Economic Service (RITES) in January.",1

The seer was heading to Haridwar from Prayagraj (Allahabad). The driver is said to have slept while driving the SUV, which crashed into the truck ahead.UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath and BJP president Amit Shah condoled the demise of Hansdevacharya, who was the leader of the Bairagis campaigning for construction of a Ram temple in Ayodhya at the site where Babri Masjid existed.The mosque was demolished in December 1992 by karsevaks (volunteers) who had gathered in the UP town following a call given by Vishwa Hindu Parishad and supported by the Bharatiya Janata Party to push for construction of a Ram temple there. The VHP and the BJP have maintained that it was the place where Lord Ram was born.The Supreme Court is hearing the title suit in the matter after a judgment of the Allahabad High Court was challenged before it.

390,"Tragedies are becoming far too commonThe Indian Air Force can begin addressing the problem by being more transparent and releasing periodic reports on accidents and their causes.A still from a video footage shows an aircraft in flames after two aircrafts of IAF's aerobatic team Surya Kiran crashed near the Yelahanka airbase in Bengaluru, Feb 19, 2019(PTI)During the rehearsal for the Aero India show currently underway, two Hawk Mk 132 aircrafts collided resulting in the death of one pilot. The tragic news comes close on the heels of a Mirage 2000 crash on February 1, which led to loss of two pilots. A Jaguar crashed on January 28 and a Mig-27 crashed on February 12, thankfully without any loss of lives.The problem of crashes is not new for the Indian Air Force (IAF). The year 2018 saw a number of crashes involving Sukhoi, Jaguar and MIG planes. In fact, the number of accidents that IAF has had with MIGs — 482 in 40 years till 2012 — had earned the aircraft the dubious title of “flying coffin”. The infamy was immortalised in the iconic film Rang De Basanti in 2006.Why are IAF planes so accident prone? One, it is simply the problem of slow movement on defence modernisation. IAF is flush with ageing planes on their last legs. Chief Justice of India Ranjan Gogoi recently dismissed a plea asking for judicial enquiry into the February 1 Mirage crash claiming that the aircraft was very old and “bound to crash”.Two, IAF is known to make its pilots undergo intense and rigorous training. Such a practice puts immense strain on the limited number of aircraft, pilots and the support staff. Three, tardy maintenance and upgrade of some of these planes has also been an issue. IAF puts the blame on HAL, which indeed is running way behind the schedule on a number of projects including the Mirage 2000 upgrade.Four, IAF has to operate in harsh tropical weather which is quite demanding on its planes. Then there are problems such as bird strikes, which, some estimates suggest, are responsible for 10% of accidents. It should be noted that the government scrapped a Rs 250 crore tender for buying bird detection and monitoring radars in 2015.Perhaps, IAF can begin addressing the problem by being more transparent. An annual, or even a triennial, report on accidents and their causes would be a good way to start. Some individual cases may be embarrassing to the service, but an aggregate release of data would do much good simply by shining the light on deficiencies — and ensure that more of its brave pilots do not become casualties.",0
391,"Transformation of railways in NDA budgets Prime Minister Narendra Modi had promised to transform the railways before coming to power, and he has been on track. Though there's still a lot to be done, the railways have managed to shed the image of a state enterprise impervious to change and aloof to its customers' needs. A large number of new customer services has made the railways more customer-oriented while launch of faster trains and significant upgrades of existing ones have changed the look of the railways. In Railway Budget 2014, then railway minister Sadananda Gowda pitched for reforms by proposing private and foreign direct investment and public-private partnership to meet the resource crunch. He proposed the highest-ever plan outlay of Rs 65,445 crore. He also announced plans for introduction of a bullet train in Mumbai-Ahmedabad sector. ""We need huge investment for running bullet train. There was a ban on FDI in railways. Now we would request commerce ministry to delete that clause so that thethere can be FDI in infrastructure development,"" he said. At that time, the announcement did not excite many, but the ambitious project did begin within a few years with a loan from Japan. In Railway Budget 2015-16, the new minister Suresh Prabhu kept fares unchanged and eschewed populist gestures such as new trains and stations in his maiden budget, He preferring to bring a technocrat's focus to try and improve amenities for customers, set the organisation's trajectory for the next five years and put its derailed finances back on tracks. In a historic move, the government merged the railway budget with the general budget in 2017, ending a 92-year-old practice of a separate budget for the country’s largest transporter. The total proposed outlay for 2017-18 was Rs 1,31,000 crore, an 8 per cent increase from the 2016-17 budget. Finance Minister Arun Jaitley announced that a Rail Safety Fund will be created over a period of five years with a corpus of Rs 100,000 crore. He also announced that 500 stations would be made differentlyabled-friendly by providing lifts and escalators. He promised a new Metro Rail Policy with focus on innovative models of implementation and financing, and standardisation and indigenisation of hardware and software. Budget 2018-19 gave a big boost to railways with a capital expenditure of Rs 1.48 lakh crore. ""Most of this money will be spent on capacity expansion, since it is a priority for the national transporter,"" Jaitley said. He proposed a target of doubling 18,000 km of lines and said gauge conversion was underway to eliminate capacity constraints. The minister said 36,000 km of rail track renewal had been targeted in the coming year while 4,267 unmanned railway crossings on broad gauge routes were to be eliminated in the next two years ",1
392,"Trauma care key to cut accident deathsDelhi reported the highest number of fatal road crashes during 2017 with 1,584 deaths, according to the latest available data from the ministry of road transport and highways. In the same year, 6,673 accidents were reported from the city.The AIIMS trauma centre, one of the two level 1 trauma centres in Delhi, receives around 200 to 250 cases daily, the highest in the city. Of these, over 70% are victims of road crash.(Picture for representation)Delhi reported the highest number of fatal road crashes during 2017 with 1,584 deaths, according to the latest available data from the ministry of road transport and highways. In the same year, 6,673 accidents were reported from the city.“The number of traffic deaths in Delhi is high because of the high number of road accidents. And, the infrastructure and the enforcement of traffic rules, along with the pre-hospital care systems, are to blame,” said Dr Sanjeev Bhoi, professor of emergency medicine at Jai Prakash Narayan Apex Trauma Centre, All India Institute of Medical Sciences.The AIIMS trauma centre, one of the two level 1 trauma centres in Delhi, receives around 200 to 250 cases daily, the highest in the city. Of these, over 70% are victims of road crash.And, the numbers might be under-reported.“These numbers are gathered from the police cases registered and are likely to be under-reported. Sometimes patients die days after the case is registered and this may not get updated in the records,” said Dr Rakhi Dandona, who heads the Global Burden of Disease –Road Injuries group for the State-level Disease Burden initiative.At country level, the World Health Organisation’s Global Status Report on Road Safety 2018 estimated the number of traffic deaths to be 2,99,091 in 2016, which is nearly double the 1,50, 785 deaths reported in that year.Injuries to be wary ofMost accident victims suffer from poly-trauma — injuries to more than one system of the body. But it is the head injury that leads to the highest mortality and disability.“Of all the accident cases, almost 40% come in with severe head injuries. And, in such cases, even if the patient reaches hospital on time and receives the best care, 35% die within 48 hours.Of those that survive, half are left in a vegetative state and the rest experience some sort of cognitive deficit depending on what part of the brain is affected. No one is left unscathed. Wearing a simple helmet can reduce the number of head injuries,” Dr Bhoi said.Apart from head trauma, the second most fatal is excessive bleeding. “Around 30% accident victims come in a haemorrhagic shock caused by excessive bleeding. This can be prevented by using a tourniquet. Tying a piece of cloth tightly above the area that is bleeding can reduce the blood flow,” Dr Bhoi said.How to reduce mortalityThe best way to reduce mortality is to reduce the number of accidents, the experts say. For this, there is a need to plan cities better and to improve road infrastructure.“The first step is to ensure that there are no potholes, and there are appropriate speed breakers and signage. And, the authorities should be on the lookout for and fix black spots or areas where a lot of accidents are reported. The pavements need to be improved and the roads have to be made keeping in mind the pedestrians,” said Dr Nutan Mehta, head of the new emergency and trauma wing of Dr Ram Manohar Lohia hospital.Then comes following speed limits taking safety measures such as wearing helmets and putting on seat belts.A study at the AIIMS trauma centre found that only half of the two-wheeler users were wearing helmets, only 45% had fastened it properly, and only 38.5% were wearing a helmet approved as “crash proof” by the Bureau of Indian Standards.Only 32.4% people used seat belts, showed another study from AIIMS. This is because of lax enforcement, which is the key to ensure safe driving practices.“World over, there is enough evidence to suggest that awareness alone cannot ensure safe driving practices. There is a need for strict enforcement so that people face real consequences like licences being cancelled and actually not being able to drive after the licence is cancelled. But, we do not have enough manpower to ensure that all violators get punished,” Dr Dandona said.Poor vehicular standards are also to blame. “Most of the commonly used cars in India do not adhere to the international safety standards. The New Car Assessment Programme (NCAP), which looks at how likely a driver or passenger is of surviving a crash, shows that there are only two or three cars that have a four-star rating, a norm strictly followed in the West,” Dr Bhoi said. And, even if there is a crash, to ensure that a person survives there is a need for a strong pre-hospital and hospital care.“Currently, there aren’t enough trauma care hospitals in the country, which means valuable time is lost and the patient does not get appropriate care within the first “golden” hour of the crash when the chances of survival and minimum disability is the highest. The roads are such that it is also difficult for ambulance to reach an accident site and then take the patient to the hospital in time,” said Dr Dandona.People at riskPeople walking on the roads and those driving two-wheelers have the highest risk of severe injury in road crashes. In India, 40% of all road crash deaths were reported in motorised two and three-wheeler riders and 10% in pedestrians.“In India as in any developing countries, higher number of injuries and deaths are reported in two wheeler riders and pedestrians because of the traffic mix. We have high speed cars moving along with bikes, cycles and pedestrians on the roads. This is because missing or occupied pavements and cycles lanes and the attitude of the people as well,” Dr Dandona said.Also, men outnumber women when it comes to road crashes.A study of demographics of the victims of road crash in Delhi showed that 84% were men and just 16% were women. Besides, almost 50% of the victims belonged to the 16-30 age group.“These are the groups that are more likely to travel for work. The way we have developed the infrastructure of the city, people have to travel long distances to get to work. There are commercial hubs and residential hubs in Delhi. Ideally, people should be working in their neighbourhood. If that were the case, 90% of the people would be off roads in the city,” said Dr Mehta of RML hospital.People in a hurry also lead to a higher number of crashes. Of the 900 accident victims interviewed for a 2017 study, 54.2% reported that they were in a hurry to reach somewhere. The same study reported that 26.1% were having a conversation with co-rider or on a cell phone. Drivers using mobile phones are 4 times more likely to be involved in a crash, according to the World Health Organisation.",0

The IAF is now left with 48 Mirage 2000 fighters.Smoke billows from the wreckage of a Mirage 2000 aircraft which crashed in Bengaluru Friday morning.(ANI)Two pilots of the Indian Air Force (IAF) were killed on Friday after their Mirage 2000 fighter jet crashed during takeoff at the Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) airport here.The French-origin trainer aircraft, manufactured by Dassault Aviation, was on an acceptance sortie after being upgraded at HAL, an IAF spokesperson said in New Delhi. IAF has ordered a probe into the accident that comes four days after a Jaguar aircraft went down in Kushinagar, Uttar Pradesh.First inducted into IAF in 1984, Friday’s crash was the 11th accident involving the Mirage 2000 fleet. The IAF is now left with 48 Mirage 2000 fighters.HAL identified the two pilots as squadron leaders Samir Abrol and Siddartha Negi.Commissioned into IAF in June 2008, Abrol, 33, was from Ghaziabad. Negi, 31, hailed from Dehradun and joined IAF in June 2009.“HAL regrets to inform that one upgraded Mirage 2000 aircraft crashed during the customer acceptance flight at HAL airport here today [Friday] around 10.30 am,” the state-owned plane maker said in a statement.Officials said that the pilots had ejected from the plane but landed on its wreckage.Minutes after the crash, residents from nearby areas posted videos and images of the accident site on social media. The flight data recorder has been recovered from the site.India had in 2011 signed a $2.4-billion contract with Dassault Aviation and Thales to upgrade 51 Mirage 2000 fighters with new weapons, radars and avionics. The first two aircraft were upgraded by the firms in France followed by another two at HAL in Bengaluru. HAL is upgrading the remaining planes.The fighter that crashed was upgraded at HAL, said an official who did not want to be identified.The crash couldn’t have come at a worse time for HAL, as questions have been raised about the capabilities of the state-owned company that is going through financial trouble.Several HAL projects are running years behind schedule, including the Mirage 2000 upgrade programme, much to IAF’s dismay.The Mirage 2000 upgrade is five years behind schedule.IAF’s efforts to support HAL have affected its fighting capabilities, air force chief Air Chief Marshal BS Dhanoa said on Thursday. Speaking at a conference at the Centre for Air Power Studies in New Delhi, he was responding to criticism about IAF’s alleged dislike for the HAL-made Tejas light combat aircraft.Since Independence, 17 test pilots and engineers have lost their lives in air accidents during the testing and evaluation of indigenous planes such as Marut, Kiran, Ajeet, Saras and AWACS (airborne warning and control systems) prototype aircraft.",0

396,"Two striking examples of BMC inefficiency in 1 dayThis week, the newly restored Flora Fountain developed a leak within a couple of days of its inauguration and a short distance away large chunk of Marine Drive caved inThis week, Mumbai woke up to two fine examples of how well the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) runs the city. The newly restored fountain at Hutatma Chowk developed a leak within a couple of days of its inauguration. And a short distance away, a fairly large chunk of Marine Drive, Mumbai’s most famous and iconic promenade, caved in near the crossing where this road turns towards Churchgate station.The general understanding in Mumbai is that no matter what happens elsewhere, Marine Drive is among those areas — Malabar Hill, Breach Candy, Peddar Road, Carmichael Road, Altamount Road, Napean Sea Road being some others — that are very well looked after.The crème de la crème of Mumbai resides in these areas as well as the most powerful, among them leading politicians, bureaucrats, BMC officials and police chiefs. Maintaining these areas hassle-free is not a new development. It has been so historically.Among these, Marine Drive enjoys prime of place. This is the road that gives the city so much of its aesthetic beauty, glamour and character, starting from the outer edge of Girgaum Chowpatty and leading up to the southern end where the Gateway of India stands, taking in its sweep Nariman Point and Mantralaya, where the state’s seat of power is located.How could anything go wrong on this road one might ask? Well, what excellent evidence to the contrary. Or perhaps this is democracy at work, where every area is treated equally badly!And as for Flora Fountain’s short-lived rejuvenation, it makes it easier to understand why we have pipes that don’t take water where most badly needed and waste it elsewhere.If these mishaps were not so serious, it would be almost comical. That this should happen in the country’s leading city, in prime locations and both of them so close to the BMC headquarters, is the deep irony. What hope then for other, less prominent areas?The Marine Drive cave-in was fortunately anticipated in the nick of time, preventing accidents and casualties. What if one or a couple of cars were travelling over the part where the road caved in, it could have led to a monumental tragedy.Flora Fountain’s malfunction was not a threat to life, but was a setback nonetheless and stymied months of effort at reviving one of the city’s major landmarks.It becomes particularly galling when you consider that the BMC is the richest civic body in the country. Its annual budget is in excess of ?27,000 crore, so resources for development, maintenance and repairs can hardly be the issue.Why then should such things occur — or recur — considering that there had been a cave-in on Marine Drive a few years earlier too?The problem lies in the lack of proper planning and detailing of such work that is undertaken – as seems to be the case in the Marine Drive road collapse, as well as callous disregard for completing the ‘last mile’ diligently, as the Flora Fountain setback highlights.Authorities associated with both these projects have been at pains to highlight what has gone wrong. But their explanations don’t wash because all these should have been factored in, leaving zero scope for the trouble that has been witnessed.Accidents can happen and always come unannounced. It is the preparedness for such eventualities that matters.This is where the civic body has been utterly incompetent, for there have been several instances in the past where this has showed up.A diatribe against the BMC, however, is not the purpose of this column, nor is that of much help. A great deal has already been written about the efficiency or otherwise of the corporation. More words will be wasted.Whether the corporation will wake up now, after the recent problems is moot.The more pertinent question is whether citizens will wake up, say enough is enough, and demand stringent accountability.",0
397,"Two, 3-wheeler riders worst hit: WHOThe actual number of deaths, however, could be higher as per the report, which estimates that there were 2.99 lakh traffic fatalities. This means, an estimated 22.6 people per 100,000 population died of traffic accidents in India in 2016.Two and three-wheeler riders accounted for 40% of all traffic deaths in India in 2016, according to WHO’s Global Status Report on Road Safety 2018, which puts the total traffic deaths at 1.5 lakh that year.The actual number of deaths, however, could be higher as per the report, which estimates that there were 2.99 lakh traffic fatalities. This means, an estimated 22.6 people per 100,000 population died of traffic accidents in India in 2016.“The highest number of casualties are reported among people on two and three wheelers, and let me add pedestrians, because they do not have a protective exterior exposing them to more injuries. Also, the kind of speed and traffic mix in India means that cars with higher speed limits drive on the same road with two-wheelers with lower speed limit, making them more accident prone,” said Dr Rakhi Dandona who heads the Global Burden of Disease –Road Injuries group for the State-level Disease Burden initiative.Globally, 1.35 million people died in traffic crashes the same year.“The report shows that progress has been achieved in important areas such as legislation, vehicle standards and improving access to post-crash care. This progress has not, however, occurred at a pace fast enough. At this rate, the Sustainable Development Goal to halve road traffic deaths by 2020 will not be met,” the report stated.The estimated number of traffic fatalities is almost double, according to the World Health Organisation Report, which puts the absolute number of deaths at 2.99 lakhs. In 2016, 22.6 people in every 100,000 population died in traffic crashes.After two and three-wheeler, the highest number of deaths were reported in passengers of cars (12%), drivers and passengers of heavy trucks (11%), and pedestrians (10%) after deaths in two and three wheeler drivers.Looking at the factors leading to fatalities, the report found that India meets “two to six” international vehicle safety standards. The limit on blood alcohol concentration as per the law in India is 0.03 g/dl. Reducing blood alcohol concentrations from 0.1 g/dl to 0.05 g/dl may contribute to reduction in alcohol related road traffic fatalities by 6 - 18%, the report states.However, the maximum speed limit on urban and rural roads in India is 100 kmph. This is much higher than the speed of 50 kmph or less the report was looking at. “A 5% reduction in speed can reduce the number of fatalities by 30%,” it said.“There is a need to take a multi-sectoral approach to tackle road crashes and deaths. There has to better infrastructure that allows for safer travel, better vehicles, improved intervention and enforcement of laws, and a health system that can take care of accident victims. We need to look at the problem from a health perspective. Why should it be under the ministry of road transport and highways?” said Dr Dandona.India is the fourth-largest vehicle producer in the world.",0
398,"Two-year-old survives Audi-dumper crash in Delhi that killed his parents, grandmotherThree members of the Singhal family - Sumit Singhal, his wife Ruchi and his mother - were killed when a dumper truck overturned on their Audi car in in outer Delhi’s Rohini in the early hours of Wednesday.Passers-by look at the mangled remains of an Audi car which collided with a dumper at Rohini, in New Delhi, Wednesday, Feb. 20, 2019, killing three of the four occupants of the car. (PTI)When Sonu saw a dumper truck topple on top of an Audi in outer Delhi’s Rohini in the early hours of Wednesday, he didn’t believe that there would be any survivors in the car. An hour later though, he believes he witnessed a “miracle”.The three adult occupants of the car were crushed to death, but a two-year-old child was rescued with minor injuries. “Hundreds of us had gathered at the spot, but we were helpless. There was no way we could have pulled anyone out of the car. The truck and the soil it was carrying were too heavy for us,” said Sonu, who sleeps on the roadside and sells black salt on a cart.“We thought all inside the car were dead, but then, we heard the cries of a child and we were desperate to help the child,” Sonu said.According to Anurag (goes by a single name), a friend of the Singhal family that was involved in the mishap, a crane arrived about an hour later. The truck was removed and the car’s occupants were taken out of the mangled remains of the vehicle. “Only the child was alive. The others looked dead,” Anurag said.Anurag happened to be at the spot as he was among several residents from the neighbourhood in Rohini Sector 15 who were returning from a wedding in Gurugram. “We were in Gurugram to attend the wedding of the daughter of our former neighbour, Rajesh Goyal. The Singhal family was among the attendees,” Anurag said.Anurag reached the accident spot just moments after the mishap. “The child survived because he was sleeping on the rear seat. The car’s roof probably did not crush him,” Anurag said.The child’s parents, Sumit Singhal and Ruchi Singhal, got married over three years ago. They lived with Sumit’s parents and his younger sister in their five-storey home in Rohini Sector 15. The family had rented out some floors, and also had a thriving pulses processing unit in Bawana.Overloading menaceAs most of the soil being carried by the dumper had landed on the road and the Audi, police said they are not in a position to determine if the “offending vehicle” was overloaded.But investigators said it was possible that the dumper was overloaded. “The truck must have been going at a high speed, and the load it was carrying may have caused it to topple over,” a senior police officer said.According to data from the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways, the menace of overloading in goods vehicles has resulted in 817 mishaps and cost 141 lives in Delhi between 2015 and 2017.At the national level, overloading has been cited as the trigger for 1,94,153 mishaps and 67,349 deaths in the three years between 2015 and 2017. In that period, these mishaps accounted for anywhere between 11.9% and 15.4% of all accidents in India. In terms of deaths, overloading accounted for around 15% of all fatalities.Alok Kumar, joint commissioner of police (Delhi traffic police), said his personnel cannot prosecute goods vehicles for overloading. “We do not have the facility for weighing trucks and their goods because of which we cannot determine if they are overloaded,” the JCP said.",0

The STF busted the mass copying racket during the UP Board examination of physics paper.Police recovered Rs 12.50 lakh cash, solved answer sheets, fake identity cards of 12 invigilators, who were doing duty illegally. Besides, two pistols, 80 bullets, 16 mobile phones, 31 bank passbooks, four physics books, carbon papers and a SUV, from their possession.The STF arrested Yogendra Pal Singh, a school principal and centre superintendent, 12 fake invigilators including one from Haridwar, two solvers, one clerk and a teacher who was the mastermind behind the racket.The mass copying gang was operating at Janata Inter College, Muzaffarnagar and hired solvers from Delhi, Haryana and Uttarakhand were found taking the exam illegally, said police. According to STF, most of the invigilators were not regular teachers. They were hired by the centre superintendent to facilitate copying. These invigilators were teachers of physics, the subject for which the exam was on. This is a clear violation of exam rulebook that mandates that non subject teachers can only be made invigilator.SSP STF Abhishek Singh said as examination was being conducted under CCTV camera vigil and these invigilators were found dictating answer from outside the classroom. A team of STF led by Vimal Gautam along with DIoS Muzaffarnagar raided Janta Inter College and arrested many persons.Singh said after quizzing various people it came to light that one Intekab is the mastermind of the gang. After being interrogated, he revealed that he had large network of copying gang in bordering states of UP like Delhi, Haryana and Uttarakhand.“To help students pass the examination, the gang charges something between Rs 25,000 to Rs 55,000 from each student. Every year nearly 2000 students approach this gang to help them pass the examination. In return the gang makes about Rs 7-8 crore in exam,” SSP STF claimed.SSP, STF, said the teachers were caught solving the exam papers in the laboratory. They were using carbon papers to write multiple copies. They were dictating answers in such a way that CCTV cameras were unable to catch them.",0

406,"24th February 2010: When Sachin Tendulkar rewrote history books in GwaliorSachin Tendulkar is widely regarded as one of the best batsmen in the history of the game and on this day, nine years ago, the Indian superstar etched his name in history books against South Africa in Gwalior.Tendulkar became the first cricketer ever to score a double century in ODIs as he powered the hosts to a series-clinching win over the Proteas at the Captain Roop Singh Stadium.Riding on Tendulkar’s unbeaten 200, India put on a huge total of 401/3 in 50 overs. Depite AB De Villiers’101 ball 114, the visitors were dismissed for just 248 and they fell short by 153 runs.The Master Blaster’s innings included 25 boundaries and three massive sixes and he crossed the 200-run mark off just 147 deliveries at a healthy strike rate of 136.0.Tendulkar was rightly adjudged the man of the match as he showed the way to other that crossing the 200-run mark in ODIs was possible. Following Tendulkar’s heroics, many others took the leaf out of his book and went on to smash double centuries in the 50-over format of the game.India has most representation in this exclusive club as current vice-captain Rohit Sharma has done it thrice during the course of his illustrious career. Rohit’s 264 against Sri Lanka in Kolkata in 2014 also remains the highest individual score in ODIs.Apart from Tendulkar and Rohit, Virender Sehwag is the third Indian on this elite list as he smashed 219 against Windies in Indore in 2011.The other such cricketers are New Zealand’s Martin Guptill (237* vs WI), West Indies’ Chris Gayle (215 vs ZIM) and Pakistan’s Fakhar Zaman (210* vs ZIM).",0

The Government Railway Police (GRP) along with their counterparts at the Railway Protection Force (RPF) recently conducted a security audit of the stations, which revealed that there are at least 1090 unsecured spots between CSTM-Thane-Panvel and Churchgate-Bandra that need quick attention, according to Niket Kaushik, Commissioner, Government Railway Police (GRP).   Owing to heavy and uncontrolled footfall at the railway stations, the ‘minimum standard security’ apparatus continues to be compromised as all the stations have unauthorised entry and exit points. This makes all the stations unsafe and the railways have been informed to plug them, however, very little has been done.  The highest number of vulnerable points, 315, was found in Vashi GRP’s Thane-Vashi trans-harbour line, which is last on the list of security. “The audit is still underway and is being conducted by all the 17 police stations in Mumbai’s suburban section. The data will help to analyse the loopholes and improved coordination among the agencies and police. The concerned agencies (railways and BMC) are being informed about the findings for improving things on ground,” said Niket Kaushik, GRP commissioner.",1

US and North Korean negotiators have reached in advance and hammering out outcomes, if any, that could include the two countries exchanging liaison offices.Trump and Kim will hold multiple meetings, following the Singapore template from last summer, their first summit — a one-on-one, then one with their officials and a lunch, US officials have said.“We both expect a continuation of the progress made at first Summit in Singapore,” Trump wrote on Twitter Sunday.“Denuclearization?” he ended that post with a question mark.Also read | ‘Very, very bad situation between India and Pakistan’: Trump on Pulwama attackBut did not provide an answer. He went on, instead, reprise for North Korea the prospect of economic prosperity in exchange for giving up its nuclear weapons programme: “Chairman Kim realizes, perhaps better than anyone else, that without nuclear weapons, his country could fast become one of the great economic powers anywhere in the World. Because of its location and people (and him), it has more potential for rapid growth than any other nation!”Complete and verifiable denuclearization by North Korea is the key US goal but experts and US intelligence officials insist Pyongyang has not even made a start yet, though they agree it has also not conducted nuclear and missile tests since the two sides began talking earlier 2018, leading up to the June summit.North Korea is seeking, in return, a peace treaty to formally end the Korean war to replace the 1953 armistice, lifting of economic sanctions, and security guarantees. Kim hasn’t managed any of that yet yet, but his June meeting with Trump has given him a leg up over his father and grandfather, who ruled the country before him, as the first North Korean leader to meet a sitting American president.",0

(PTI Photo)The Indian Air Force (IAF) on Wednesday conducted a memorial fly-past at the Yelahanka air base for Wing Commander Sahil Gandhi, a day after the fighter pilot was killed in a mid-air collision between two British-origin Hawk advanced jet trainers while practising aerobatic manoeuvres for the five-day Aero India-2019.Three IAF fighter jets — a Sukhoi-30 fighter flanked by a Jaguar and a Tejas light combat aircraft — flew the time-honoured “missing man” formation to honour Gandhi at the inaugural fly-past of Asia’s biggest air show.“The formation pays tribute to the fallen pilot. If he was alive, he would have been flying too in the finger four formation,” said former IAF chief Air Chief Marshal Fali Major.Gandhi, 37, was part of the IAF’s renowned Surya Kiran Aerobatic Team (SKAT), which consists of the country’s finest pilots trained to perform complex stunts. Two other pilots injured in the twin Hawk crash - Wing Commander VT Shelke and Squadron Leader TJ Singh - are recuperating in an IAF hospital.A Rafale aircraft of the French air force also made a low pass during the flying display as a mark of respect to Gandhi, who hailed from Haryana’s Hisar. A radio call given by the French pilot announcing this was broadcast over the PA system on the ground. Captain Nativel Babouc, who flew the Rafale in a low pass to honour Gandhi, said, “It was my way to pay homage to the fallen pilot. We fighter pilots are one big family no matter which country we come from.”IAF chief Air Chief Marshal BS Dhanoa said it was too early to say what went wrong and only an investigation would reveal the cause of the accident. The jets were in a mirror manoeuvre – one flying inverted above the other – seconds before the collision that has become the major talking point at the 12th edition of the air show. While SKAT is not taking part in the air show any longer because IAF wants to pinpoint the reasons for the accident, the display team’s Hawks were seen parked outside an apron near the main runway of the air base.Defence minister Nirmala Sitharaman declared the air show open, asserting that it intended to put India on the global map as “a runway to a billion opportunities”.The IAF’s Sarang helicopter display team performed a string of breathtaking manoeuvres amid cheers and applause from the spectators, including ministers from foreign countries, and top military officials including the three service chiefs.Another highlight of the biennial show was a fly-by performed by a B-52 Stratofortress bomber that came from the Andersen Air Force Base in Guam.Of the seven fighter jets competing for an Indian programme to build 114 planes locally under the strategic partnership (SP) model, only Rafales, F-18s and F-16s were part of the flying display.",0

On Thursday, the Congress cited media reports to allege that Modi continued shooting for a film in the Corbett National Park on February 14 for “self propagation”, and stayed put till the evening despite the attack on a CRPF convoy in south Kashmir’s Pulwama district in the afternoon that day.Congress’ chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala, addressing a press conference, also claimed the prime minister continued to “have tea and samosas at seven o’clock in a PWD guest house when every single Indian household didn’t eat food (that day)”.",0
412,"‘Sabka vinaash’: Yogi Adityanath’s take on SP, BSP, and Congress in UPUttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath has said while the BJP’s motto was “Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas”, the opposition SP, BSP and the Congress in the state stood for “Sabka Vinaash” (destruction of everyone).His comments came when a discussion on the budget was underway at the Uttar Pradesh Legislative Assembly.“SABKA stands for SP (Samajwadi Party), BSP (Bahujan Samaj Party) and Congress. Our Sabka slogan speaks about development of all. Their Sabka speaks about destruction of everyone...We stand for Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikaas. Yours is Sabka Saath, Sabka Vinaash,” Adityanath said intervening the discussion.Taking a dig at the Congress, he said, “Every citizen of this country is proud of our traditions. If the Congress had tried to take pride in the country’s traditions, it would not have come to its lowest tally in the state and the country. This situation has come as the Congress had insulted the culture and traditions of the country.” “When you want to garner votes, you show your janeu (sacred threads worn by Hindus). People have even started telling their ‘Gotra’ (sub-caste)... And even the SP did not find the Congress suitable to include it in the SP-BSP alliance,” the chief minister said, targeting the opposition Congress in the state.Adityanath also took a jibe at Ram Gobind Chaudhary (SP), the Leader of Opposition in the UP Assembly. “If you (Ram Gobind Chaudhary) had even an iota of sympathy for the poor, you would have been with Shivpal Yadav’s political party and not with the SP. (Ram Manohar) Lohiaji had spoken about socialism, which is not seen in your party (SP). In reality, it is Shivpal Yadav who takes the name of Lohiaji. You (SP) people do not take his name,” he said.He briefed the House on the various aspects of the budget and spoke at length on the various schemes of the state government pertaining to women, girls, farmers, labourers, youth, villages, electricity, roads, Metro rail, development of airports, health and education.“In a nutshell, I can say that this is a holistic budget. This is a budget which has taken care of the interests of all sections of the society and has given a new impetus to development. This is a budget which has brought smile and prosperity on every face,” Adityanath said.He announced that the state government will soon enhance the honorarium of Anganwadi and ASHA workers, those in the Panchayati Raj Department, village sevaks and cooks who make mid-day meals.Speaking on the recent terror attack in Pulwama that claimed the lives of 40 CRPF personnel, Adityanath said, “The anger which is visible after the Pulwama terror attack is an eye-opener for the public representatives. If a person indulges in appeasement of self-interest, and encourages terrorism, then the same anger will be visible which is today seen on the streets.”The UP chief minister said the BJP government has worked hard to put the derailed system of the state back on track.“UP, which was languishing among the bottom states of the country during the governments of the SP and the BSP, is now on the path of becoming the number one,” Adityanath said.",0

We do not want to be an elitist company. That’s not -- we want to be an egalitarian company and we’ve got a lot of work going on in developing markets,” Williams was quoted as saying in a Burlington Times News report late on Sunday.During his speech, Williams discussed several topics, including the rising cost of the Apple products and inaccuracy of analyst cost estimates.“The stories that come out about the cost of our products (have been) the bane of my existence from the beginning of time, including our early days.“Analysts don’t really understand the cost of what we do and how much care we put into making our products,” he told students.Citing Apple Watch as an example, the tech giant COO said the company “built an entire physiology lab with 40 licensed nurses and enlisted the help of 10,000 participants to further study how calories are burned in various fitness exercises”.According to Apple CEO Tim Cook, there are several factors why iPhone sales are not picking up in the emerging markets.“The customers are holding on to their older iPhones a bit longer than in the past. When you pair this with the macroeconomic factors, particularly in emerging markets, it resulted in iPhone revenue that was down 15 per cent from last year,” Cook told analysts recently.Analysts say they expect some kind of price correction going forward as Apple has given indications that they will look at pricing outside the US closely now.",0

Four of the sixes came off Kevin O’Brien in the 17th over which reaped 28 runs in all.One giant hit off Shane Gelkate went over the stands and out of the ground.Zazai’s stocks have risen dramatically despite missing a place in the Indian Premier League this season.In October, he became only the third batsman to hit six sixes in a T20 over for his Afghanistan Premier League side Kabul Zwanan.He equalled the record for the fastest T20 half century in 12 balls in the same match.Stirling hardly knew who to throw into the breach as a bowler.Boyd Rankin finally claimed a wicket for the Irish when Ghani -- who made 73 off 43 balls -- played a careless shot over long-on that Joshua Little caught diving as he ran in from the boundary.While Stirling and Kevin O’Brien were no slouches, they never kept up with the mountainous run rate, which had risen to 17 by the 10th over.Afghanistan’s star bowler Rashid Khan came on for the 11th over and was furious when captain Asghar Afghan spilled a relatively simple catch off his first ball to give O’Brien a chance with Ireland on 109.O’Brien was bowled in the next over by Fareed Ahmad for a 37 which included two sixes.Rashid bowled Andy Balbirnie in the following over for two and Stirling started to run out of reliable partners.Mujeeb Ur Rahman claimed Stirling -- who as a consolation made Ireland’s top T20 score of 91 off 50 balls -- when he was caught by replacement Najeeb Tarakai on the boundary.The final match of the series is on Sunday. The two play five one-day internationals from February 28 and a one-off Test in March.",0

However, at a joint press conference called by the UD ministry, Delhi Metro and Reliance Infrastructure on Monday, the differences between the agencies emerged.Sudhir Krishna, secretary, urban development ministry, said, “There were no defects in the civil construction when the service on the line started in February 2010.” Sumit Banerjee, CEO (infrastructure), Reliance Infrastructure, countered: “There were damages since day one but they went unnoticed. They came to light during our recent annual inspection.”Meanwhile, the urban development ministry has ordered a proper examination. “Since the magnitude of damage is quite high, it has been ordered to examine all 2,100 bearings,” Krishna said.The ministry and the Railway board have formed a two-member inquiry committee to identify the responsible person/s or agency and investigate in details. As repair of these defects is likely to take a long time, the August deadline for the re-opening of the high-speed line will be missed, officials said.

The Trinamool Congress and the DMK, both of whom have to face assembly elections next year, had to do some shadow boxing so as not to be seen as openly supporting the increase.The opposition, including the Left and the BJP, predictably, went all out to attack the government, demanding a rollback and blaming it for further stoking inflation.Food inflation on Thursday rose marginally to 16.96 per cent from 16.12 per cent last week.For the Trinamool and the DMK, it was a delicate balancing act.Railway Minister Mamata Banerjee stayed away from the meeting of the Empowered Group of Ministers though the increase of diesel prices would directly impact her ministry. Railway ministry officials, however, said that although the the fuel hike would increase its expense on diesel by Rs 470 crore, passenger fares will remain untouched.Fertiliser and Chemical Minister M.K. Alagiri simply read out a note to say that the hike would push up prices of other items further. “Any further increase will hit the purchasing power of the lower middle income families,” he said.When he even proposed a rollback, Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee snapped: “What rollback?” Alagiri fell silent.Banerjee said later, “I am unhappy and we do not support the hike.” But she clarified, “We do not want to quarrel as it won’t look nice. I will talk to the government to reconsider”.The government did consult allies on Thursday before taking the decision.Petroleum Minister Murli Deora spoke to DMK’s A. Raja and Mukherjee had an hour-long discussion with Banerjee. The Trinamool leader made it clear that she will not attend the EgoM as it could send a wrong signal to her electorate.At Friday’s meeting, Agriculture Minister and NCP chief Sharad Pawar said that if the government wanted a hike it must not dither on it. “If God is willing, prices will come down in future.”The Congress was on the defensive. “The government must have been constrained to take this step,” said spokesperson Jayanthi Natarajan.Privately many Congress workers expressed their unhappiness with the hike that is being seen as hurting the aam aadmi.The BJP demanded that the taxes should be rationalised to make fuel cheaper and dismissed the government’s defence that it was the NDA that had started to dismantle the administered pricing mechanism first.",1

The chief minister’s offer came a day after Puri said the Delhi government will have to pay Rs 3,000 crore annually for five years to put off the metro fare hike, set to be implemented from Tuesday.

The report, published in thewire.in, said Shah’s company Temple Enterprises Pvt Limited was “engaged in negligible activity” in the financial years ending March 2013 and 2014 but “jumped to a turnover of Rs 80.5 crore in 2015-16”. The company had taken an unsecured loan during the year for Rs 15.78 crore, the news report said, adding that it finally wound up in October 2016 after posting a loss. Jay Shah issued a statement saying the article “makes false, derogatory and defamatory imputation against me by creating in the minds of right thinking people an impression that my business owes its ‘success’ to my father Sri Amit Bhai Shah’s political position.” Read the story here.Send your child to school or be locked up in jail with no food, water: UP ministerUttar Pradesh minister Om Prakash Rajbhar has warned that parents who fail to send their wards to schools will be locked up in police stations without food and water.

In an unprecedented move, the ministry has brought to an end a 36-year-old protocol where it was mandatory for general managers to present themselves on arrival and departure of the Railway Board chairman and other board members during zonal visits. As part of a massive overhaul of the culture of privilege prevalent in the ministry, the Railway Board has decided to do away with the instructions of a 1981 circular that mandated such protocol.

May and leading lights in the Conservative Party took to the print media on Sunday to warn of unrest paving the way for Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn into Downing Street. May appeared to have survived another threat to her leadership after a bid to oust her by former party chairman Grant Shapps collapsed when it did not find much support among party MPs.

After the win in Ranchi in the first T20 of the three-match series, Virat Kohli-led side can very well hope for another series triumph against the team from Down Under. The dominance of the Virat Kohli-led side in the past few months has shown its potential to be one of the greatest Indian sides ever. It very well reminds of the MS Dhoni-led Indian team that dominated world cricket a little while back. Even reaching the heights of Steve Smith or Ricky Ponting-led Australian cricket teams is no longer a distant dream, it seems. “In the current era there are many teams who are almost at par. So, it would be great if we achieve the same results now, what Australia did in old days,” Dhawan, who remained unbeaten on 15 in India’s nine-wicket win in the first T20I, said.

It has become a victim of coalition politics in both UPA-I and UPA-II. The ministry has become an orphan and is surviving without any protection or guidance,"" BJP spokesperson Jagat Prakash Nadda said.The party, led by its president Nitin Gadkari, condoled the death of over 60 people due to derailment of Kalka mail at Fatehpur in Uttar Pradesh on Sunday.Nadda held Prime Minister, who has kept the Railways portfolio with himself since Mamata Banerjee resigned to become chief minister of West Bengal, responsible for the poor state of affairs in the ministry.""The Prime Minister is squarely responsible for this... It is his weakness that he never intervened when Lalu Prasad and Mamata Banerjee were running the ministry,"" he said.He alleged that the UPA government was ""insensitive"" and warned that ""passing the buck"" will not do.Nadda also blamed former railway ministers Mamata Banerjee and Lalu Prasad for the problems being faced by Indian Railways today.""As Railway Minister in UPA-I, Prasad had made tall claims of profits and given wrong figures. He also projected himself as a management guru at that time. Mamata Banerjee, who succeeded him, deflated his tall claims. But this ministry has now become a joke which is unbearable,"" Nadda said.Referring to the recommendations of the HR Khanna committee, appointed by the NDA government to study rail safety and other issues, Nadda asked why it was shelved.""In 2002-03, the Khanna Committee had recommended a Rail Safety Fund with a corpus of Rs 15,000 crore. The Atal Bihari Vajpayee government had sanctioned Rs 17,000 crore after factoring in inflation,"" he said.Enumerating other achievements of the Railway ministry during the erstwhile NDA government, the BJP spokesperson maintained that 17,000 km of rail track renewal, building of 3,000 rail bridges, upgrading of signals at 950 stations and improvement in security and other policy matters were approved by the Vajpayee regime.He alleged that all these projects were abandoned by the ministry once Lalu Prasad took charge. He further accused Banerjee of contributing her bit to the deterioration of the ministry.""The Railway Ministry migrated to Kolkata during Mamata Banerjee's time. She had a Vision 2020 but we all know her vision right from the time she took office was something else,"" Nadda said, alluding to Banerjee's aim of becoming the chief minister of West Bengal during her tenure as railway minister.The BJP General Secretary said Sunday's accident was a result of lack of long term planning by the ministry.""The Minister of state for railways (Mukul Roy) was not ready to go to the site of the accident. He had to be told by the Prime Minister to go. Railways is suffering due to coalition compulsions. No monitoring of projects is being done. One lakh posts of traffic and security personnel are lying vacant. Political will is needed,"" Nadda said.In his condolence message, Gadkari said the government did not take immediate steps to improve rail safety and the situation deteriorated further. He urged the government to take prompt and effective steps for the safety of people.",1

So what is the harm in paying for a service that will be available on their mobile phone,” said a senior railway official, requesting anonymity.The mobile ticketing for suburban trains was first announced in the 2014-15 interim budget presented in February 2014. However, the project didn’t take off until July — its original deadline.With this service, commuters will be able to book tickets and renew seasonal passes on their mobile. Each commuter will receive a code via SMS after booking the ticket and the money will be deducted from their mobile wallet, which they have to create with the railways.Railway officials are also in the process of creating an interface with banks where the ticket amount can be also deducted through internet banking.The commuter has to insert this SMS code into an Automatic Ticket Vending Machine (ATVM) and procure the printed ticket. The service will initially be available at five stations on the Western Railway (WR) and Central Railway (CR), respectively.On CR, the service will be available at Kalyan, Kurla, Dadar, CST and Thane stations, while Churchgate, Bandra, Dadar, Andheri and Borivli on the WR will have the service.Gradually, these ATVMs will be installed at all stations, said the railway official.Commuter activists, however, claimed the additional charges are not justified.“Railways are not incurring much cost to provide the service. Rather, they should consistently increase the fare and invest in better rail infrastructure and new projects,” said Ashok Datar, transport expert.",1

Roads And Railways ProjectsBy Accommodation Times News ServiceThe Centre gave its green signal for investments worth more than Rs.27,000 crore in new highways and railway lines across the country to boost economic growth.The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) approved infrastructure projects worth Rs.27, 328 crore for expansion of railway lines in 11 states and development of 1,120 km national highways in five states.“The Cabinet decisions are a continuation of the government’s commitment to support infrastructure development particularly expanding the national highways beyond the existing ones,” said Manish Agarwal, partner and leader, infrastructure, PwC India. “This will augur well for passenger and freight movement and is very positive for the infrastructure sector, he said.Infrastructure boostThe government plans to increase its investments in the infrastructure sector. About 8,300 kilometres of roads involving more than Rs.1 lakh crore investments were revived, said Finance Minister Arun Jaitley in his Budget speech. Total investments earmarked in the current fiscal for roads and railways sectors amounts to Rs.2.18 lakh crore. The Centre is also augmenting port capacity by developing greenfield projects in both eastern and western coasts. In the aviation sector, the Centre plans to revive torpid airports.The railway expansion programme includes nine projects involving 1,937 km of track construction at an estimated cost of Rs.20, 867 crore. The projects include construction of second railway line between New Bongaigaon and Kamakhya in Assam. The government also gave its approval to build third and fourth railway line projects on the North South and East West Corridors of the Golden Quadrilateral.The Railway Ministry said the “fully saturated” Golden Quadrilateral will get a “big boost” helping in transportation of coal, minerals, steel and other commodities. This will also enable transportation of more passengers along these routes.“At present, the number of passengers and goods trains in the Golden Quadrilateral section is far more than its capacity resulting in heavy detention. These projects are essentially required for removing capacity constraints, reducing detention and for traffic growth,” the Railway Ministry said.Among the projects approved are third railway lines between Kharagpur and Adityapur (Jharkhand), Itarsi and Nagpur (Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra), Ballarshah and Kazipet (Maharashtra and Telangana) and Vijayawada and Gudur (Andhra Pradesh).Similar third railway lines will also be built between Rajnandgaon-Nagpur (Kalumna) in Chhattisgarh and Gondia, Bhandara and Nagpur Districts of Maharashtra, Mathura and Jhansi and Jhansi and Bina in Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh.Besides, the CCEA has also given its nod to construction of fourth railway line between Jharsuguda and Bilaspur (Odisha and Chattisgarh). The construction of these railway lines is expected to be completed in four to six years.Highway connectivityAs a part of the National Highways Interconnectivity Improvement Project (NHIIP), the government approved constructing 1,120 km national highways in Karnataka, Odisha, Bihar, Rajasthan and West Bengal with World Bank assistance. The work is scheduled to be completed by July 2024 at an estimated cost of Rs.6, 461 crore.These projects will ensure safe, fast and all weather movement of traffic on the proposed national highways mostly located in backward regions thereby improving socio-economic development, an official statement said. In a separate move, the CCEA has also approved waiver of penal interest on the Government of India loans availed by Cochin Port Trust to the tune of Rs.897 crore. The Cochin Port Trust had availed Rs.168 crore worth loans between 1936-37 and 1994-95 for various development activities from the Centre. Non-payment of loans had attracted penal interest of Rs.914 crore, according to an official statement.The Cabinet also approved leasing out 4,060 square metres of Airports Authority of India (AAI) land to Assam Industrial Development Corporation (AIDC) for setting up Centre for Perishable Cargo and its future expansion at the Guwahati Airport.",1
433,"Can we repair the train while it is running?Indian trains run at an average speed of 50-70km per hour — fairly low when compared to the trains in developed countries. Yet, train accidents in India are phenomenally higher in comparison. In 2016-17 alone, train accidents in India have resulted in 238 causalities. This despite the fact that the number of accidents ‘per million train kilometres’ in India has reduced to 0.1 in 2016-17 from 0.23 in 2006-07. Worse still, according to a study by Niti Aayog, six of every 10 rail accidents in India since 2012 have happened due to human negligence.Every time an accident happens, heads roll and a few railway officials are punished but clearly this does not seem to change the scenario much. Therefore, we may need to remind ourselves of how we landed ourselves into this situation and what is that we can do to improve it.Stocktaking must start from a simple acknowledgement that among other things, the Indian Railways has been treated as a political tool by successive governments. Back in the early 20th century, most of the Indian Railways was nationalised but since its budget formed a significant portion of the total finances of the exchequer, a practice of separate Railway budget was institutionalised from 1924 to ensure that it acts as a commercial undertaking having flexibility in financial matters and higher accountability in administration and operation.But over a period of time what evolved out of this arrangement was a split personality for Indian Railways – an observation also made in the Indian Railways Report 2001 authored under the chairmanship of Rakesh Mohan.The report suggests that on one hand Railways was to act like a self-sufficient commercial organisation while on the other, it has had large social obligations to discharge by virtue of the fact it was a government department.It goes without saying that the performance parameters of commercial projects can be quite different compared to social projects. While the former may entail focus on elements like revenue, profits or return on capital the latter may demand expansion of connectivity or increase in traffic.",1

435,"Castor seed production to be down by 20% in 2018-19: Solvent Extractors AssociationBY ET BUREAU | FEB 25, 2019, 01.12 PM ISTPost a Comment According to the castor crop survey conducted by the Solvent Extractors Association (SEA), the total production in India in 2018-19 is estimated to be down by 20% to 11.26 lakh tonnes in 2018- 19 from 14.16 lakh tonnes, estimated in 2017-18. The area and yield have declined mainly due to inadequate monsoons. The survey noted: ""Total area under castor in India for the year 2018-19 is estimated to be 769570 hectares as per the government’s estimates against 2017-18 estimate of 821600 hectare, which has decreased by 7% compared to the previous year. • Acreage has been reported to have declined in Gujarat, the largest growing state, but it is expected to be almost flat in Rajasthan and Andrhra Pradesh/Telangana. • Average yield for year 2018-19 is estimated slightly down, -12.6%, to 1520 Kg/Ha compared to 1740 Kg/Ha, based on farmer’s response about their yield expectation on present crop conditions."" SEA conducts Castor crop survey for crop estimation in major growing states like Gujarat, Rajasthan, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana every year. This year, SEA commissioned Indian Agribusiness Systems Ltd, known as “Agriwatch” in the industry, to conduct a crop estimation study in above states through field surveys and remote sense data analysis. Total area under castor in Gujarat for the year 2018-19 is taken to be 533800 hectares as per the government’s estimates, against last year’s estimate of 591000 hectares, which has declined by about 10% as compared to the previous year. Agriwatch field survey suggests area under castor to be less by 6% this year as compared to last year’s government estimate and is estimated at 554160 hectares. Using remote sensing technique, the castor acreage for the state is estimated at 549000 hectares, for .. The major reasons for lower acreage this year is less rainfall in key growing belt. ""Estimated average yield for year 2018-19 is expected to be 1751 Kg/ha against last year’s estimate of 2029Kg/ha, a fall by 13.7%. Overall, the farmers are expecting decline in yield this year due to weak monsoon, less growth of plants and less availability of water for irrigation. Total seed production in the state with decrease in area (-10%) and less yield (-13.7%), is estimated down to 9.35 lakh tons in 2018-19 from last year’s estimate of 12.00 lakh tons. The seed arrivals have started in mandis as farmers are selling in small lots to get the higher prevailing prices,"" observed the survey.",0
436,"Central Railway block on day dedicated to punctualityIn a major faux pas, the Central Railway (CR) will operate a six-hour block that will lead to the cancellation of 40 suburban trains and regulation of 20 long-distance trains on Sunday, which was dubbIn a major faux pas, the Central Railway (CR) will operate a six-hour block that will lead to the cancellation of 40 suburban trains and regulation of 20 long-distance trains on Sunday, which was dubbed Satarkata Diwas and, ironically, dedicated to punctuality.Each zonal railway was expected to show 100 per cent punctuality on the occasion, which was created to mark Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s two years in power. The initiative comes under the Hamsafar Saptah, which began on May 26 and will go on until June 1.Mr Modi had issued a diktat across 17 zonal railways, in which instructions have been given that they should observe Sewa Divas on May 28 (Saturday) and Satarkata Diwas on May 29. The Prime Minister has asked railway officers to get down to the grass-roots level on Sewa Divas and travel in trains that they run for the common man.The senior officers were also instructed to talk to passengers themselves and understand their grouses. On the following day — Satarkata Diwas — railway officials were supposed to maintain the best punctuality that is humanly possible by showing a scoreboard of 100 per cent.However, the CR has decided to operate a six-hour block from 12 am on Sunday for laying down girders for the Kasaiwada bridge at Kurla.The CR had demolished the bridge back in December last year, fearing a repeat of the Hancock bridge incident.The Railways could not bring in new rolling stock of a much greater height than old trains, as officials were afraid that the overhead equipment would crash into the bridge, which was located between the Suburban railway stations of Sandhurst Road and Byculla.A railway official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, admitted that the block should have been operated a long time ago.“The fact of the matter is the CR should have operated this block way back. It unnecessarily wasted time on other things and no one gave any thought to the Prime Minister’s anniversary and that he might declare some railway initiative,” said the official.Some officials feel that the block should have been cancelled after the railway week was declared by the railway ministry on May 25, but said that they couldn’t deny that if the block of the bridge was not carried out this weekend, they would have had to wait until the post-monsoon period.“Kurla residents are angry as it is because Ramzan is round the corner and the bridge, which is the only connect the east and west, is nowhere near completion. At the same time, it looks like we are going against the instructions from Delhi and saying we have too much work. But we could afford to not operate the block this weekend had the senior officials done the Kurla work on time,” the official said.",1

Jagan Reddy is Naidu’s bitter rival and a strong contender for the chief minister’s post.Srinivas, the father-in-law of actor and grandson of matinee idol NT Rama Rao Jr NTR, evaded a direct reply from the media on whether he would be joining Jagan’s party. Rama Rao was the founder of the TDP.He is reportedly aspiring for a YSRC ticket from either Guntur Lok Sabha seat or Chilakaluripet assembly segment in Guntur district in the general elections to be held this year. Sources in the TDP said Srinivas is a strong contender for a ticket for Chilakaluripet assembly segment since 2004. But Naidu, it is said, did not entertain his requests to avoid criticism of supporting dynastic politics.Jr NTR is married to Srinivas’ daughter Lakshmi Pranathi, who is the granddaughter of Naidu’s sister. The daughter of the chief minister’s sister is married to Srinivas. And, Naidu is NTR’s younger son-in-law. Srinivas founded a regional TV channel Studio N, which was reportedly taken over by Naidu’s son and IT minister Nara Lokesh.Daggubati Venkateswara Rao, the elder son-in-law of NTR, also met Jagan Reddy on January 27 wishing to join the YSRC and eying a ticket for his NRI son Hithesh.TDP spokesperson Dokka Manikya Varaprasad said Srinivas and Daggubati met Jagan Reddy just for seats.Srinivas’ meeting came right after Lok Sabha member P Ravindranath resigned from the Telugu Desam Party and joined the YSRC in the presence of Jagan Reddy.Jr NTR, who took an active part in the 2009 election campaign for the TDP, was allegedly sidelined in the legacy politics which shifted from the NTR family to Naidu after the chief minister took over the party reins from NTR in 1995.The actor’s father and NTR’s elder son Harikrishna, who was recently killed in a road accident, also remained away from party activities after serving the TDP as a politburo member.",0

Demand for cars, two-wheelers, white goods is sluggish. Consumer non-durables, the growth is over 12%. It is the consumer durable which is sluggish and in negative growth,"" he told PTI in an interview in New Delhi.He said manufacturing capacity is there but sentiments must change for buying durable goods.""That is one part of manufacturing. The other part of manufacturing is the core sectors - steel, iron ore, coal, power, minerals. Manufacturing must grow there also. Output must increase. We must produce more coal, more iron ore, more steel, more aluminium. That will happen as the upturn takes place,"" he said.For example, the minister said, coal production has improved while iron ore which is caught in a number of litigations will hopefully clear with Supreme Court hearing the case.""But many other core industries, the projects are stalled which is why we have now identified the projects which are stalled and we are trying to remove these bottlenecks and things will begin to move.""I think work is at pace. A special cell has been constituted. The Cabinet Secretariat is looking at the projects that can be cleared in next few week.If they require a decision by the Cabinet Committee on Investment (CCI), we will bring it. Once the core sector production goes up, you will find the industrial sector moves up and manufacturing also moves up,"" he said.Chidambaram said the Indian economy was taking time to return to high growth trajectory because of the problems in the western economies.""The upturn (in global economy) that is expected has not taken place. At the same time there is no spiralling down either. I think our economy is getting stabilised. There are some weaknesses ... There are signs that we are moving towards a more stable period. It will take time,"" he said.The minister said the upturn will not happen quickly. ""It is a slow climb. The correct approach is to keep the focus on long term. There are no quick fixes. Take measures for long term and while these measures get implemented, the medium and short term will be addressed,"" he said.The government in recent weeks taken a number of decisions like hiking gas prices, setting up of coal regulator and allowing power producers to import coal to meet shortage.""The last few weeks we have taken a number of measures keeping the long term in mind. They will yield result on the long term, but as they yield result in long term the medium and short term problems will be addressed. There will be many more decisions in July,"" Chidambaram said.He said the Union Cabinet will decide on raising FDI caps in different sectors in the second or third week of this month.""Papers will have to come from the ministry of railway, from the ministry of coal, ministry of mines, from Planning Commission, from the ministry of petroleum, ministry of fertilisers.

443,"Court seeks answer from rail ministryA week after the Hindustan Times exposed the deplorable conditions in which train passengers were being forced to travel, the Delhi High Court has sought a response from the Railways Ministry on inadequate security for passengers.The order came on a public interest litigation (PIL) that cited the three-part series, ‘India Derailed’, carried by HT and said despite claiming profit of Rs 70,000 crore, the railways was not spending a penny on passenger security and “providing hygienic atmosphere”.Expressing serious concern over the increase in the incidents of robbery and loot in trains, especially after sundown, the petition filed by Supreme Court lawyers Usha Nandini and Biju Raman said: “The trains in India are no longer safe for night travel”.A Bench of Chief Justice Ajit Prakash Shah and Justice Sanjiv Khanna wanted to know the steps the ministry was taking to ensure security, and the money being spent on it.The Bench, while refusing to be drawn into other complaints raised in the petition for the time, concentrated on the security aspect.The judges asked the ministry, Railway Board chairman, Southeast Central Railway’s general manager and divisional manager to send in the reply by April 15.Nandini had filed the PIL following a robbery on board the Delhi-Thiruvananthapuram Kerala Express.

445,"Data on mishaps suggest railways’ track record has actually improvedIn the past, when there were two sources to find the number of accident in railways, people often tried to match the two, failing to recognise there were definitional differences between themFor purposes of reporting and analysis, Indian Railways actually classifies accidents under several heads – from A to R(AFP)The National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) brings out an annual publication, Crime in India. In the past, this has also been used as source for figures on railway accidents. For example, in 2015, 26,066 people died because of railway accidents and 2,650 because of railway crossing accidents. Since 2016, NCRB no longer publishes figures on railway accidents. It only has numbers on crimes in railways. Therefore, the sole source for data on railway accidents is now Indian Railways (IR), such as Indian Railways, Year Book.In the past, when there were two sources, people often tried to match the two, failing to recognise there were definitional differences between them. Let me give you a quote from the latest Year Book. “There were 103 consequential train accidents in 2016-17 as compared to 106 accidents during 2015-16.” This does not include Konkan Railway. Notice the qualifier. We think IR reports all accidents; but IR reports only “consequential accidents”, or “serious accidents”. What is a consequential accident? An accident is anything that adversely affects the engine, rolling stock, permanent way and works, fixed installations, communications, passengers or railway servants. We usually think of accidents from a passenger perspective. But there are other angles.For purposes of reporting and analysis, IR actually classifies accidents under several heads — from A to R. For instance, A1 and A3 will be collisions of trains carrying passengers; A2 or A4 collisions of trains not carrying passengers; B represents fire or explosion in trains; C, trains running into road traffic and/or road traffic running into trains at level crossings; D, derailments; E, other train accidents; F, averted collisions; G, breach of block (a block is a segment of the track) rules; H, a train passing a signal at danger; J, equipment failures; K, failure of permanent way; L, failure of electrical equipment; M, failure of signalling and telecommunication; N, unusual incidents; P, casualties; Q, other incidents; and R, miscellaneous.What’s the difference between an unusual incident and other incident? N would be wrecking or sabotage, not usually expected. Q6 would be something like “blockade to train services due to agitation”, not something that can be classified as an unusual incident. You can see why IR’s approach to accidents is different. L2 is “no tension in OHE (overhead equipment) for more than three minutes”. This may not fit with our usual perception of an accident, but the effect can be disastrous.Read moreTo improve performance, Indian Railways must streamline the flow of trafficAcquiring land for bullet train project may get delayed, says Piyush GoyalWe are still left with the question. What is a consequential or serious accident? Certain threshold values are defined for loss to railway property and interruption to communications. A serious accident is one where there is a loss of life or grievous hurt to passengers, or those threshold values are exceeded, or where the Commissioner of Railway Safety (CRS) thinks an inquiry is needed. Data on railway accidents are also available through CRS. However, CRS doesn’t enquire into every railway accident and CRS data about accidents only include those where there has been a CRS inquiry.That Year Book will also tell you IR attended to 982 accidents in 2016-17. How can this possibly match with 103? It doesn’t because 103 refers to those that are “consequential”. There are some exclusion clauses that must be noted too: “ (a) cases of trespassers run over and injured or killed through their own carelessness or of passengers injured or killed through their own carelessness; and (b) cases involving persons being Railways servant or holding valid passes/tickets or otherwise who are killed or grievously injured while travelling outside the rolling stock of a passenger train such as on foot board, roof or buffer but excluding the inside of vestibules between coaches or run over at a level crossing or elsewhere on the railway track by a train; and (c) level crossing accident where no passenger or railway employee is killed or grievously hurt unless the Chief Commissioner of Railway Safety or Commissioner of Railway Safety is of the opinion that the accident requires the holding of an inquiry by the Commissioner of Railway Safety.”The exclusion clause makes it clear that a serious accident only includes instances where there is IR culpability. We might want to change this, but that’s the way it is today.The next time you see a figure on railway accidents, bear these in mind. If you want to check IR’s track record, ask yourself what you are interested in. Fatalities and/or injuries on trains, or fatalities/injuries at level crossings? Collisions, derailments, fires? Whatever the yardstick, you will find (a) cross-country, IR doesn’t do that badly; (b) Over time, the performance has improved. Outside the Year Book, there are 2017-18 numbers and they tell the same story.Bibek Debroy is chairman of Economic Advisory Council to the prime minister and a member of Niti AayogThe views expressed are personal",0
446,"Decision soon on removal of Pakistan cricketers’ photos from Eden Gardens: Sourav GangulyFormer India captain and Bengal cricket boss Sourav Ganguly Saturday said a decision would be taken soon on removal of Pakistan cricketers’ photographs, including that of PM Imran Khan, from the walls of Eden Gardens in the wake of the Pulwama terror attack.Ganguly’s comment came after BJP’s youth wing workers protested in front of the Eden Gardens, seeking removal of photographs of Imran and other Pakistani cricketers from the walls of the stadium.At least 64 activists of BJP youth wing were arrested for staging protest in front of the iconic Eden Gardens, a senior police officer said. They were later released on bail.“We are working on it. There will be a decision soon,” Ganguly told reporters when asked about the removal of photos.The state cricket associations of Vidarbha, Punjab and Rajasthan have already removed pictures of Pakistan cricketers in the aftermath of the terror attack which killed more than 40 CRPF personnel. Pakistan-based terror outfit, Jaish-e-Mohammad, has claims responsibility of the attack.Ganguly had earlier backed a complete boycott of cricketing ties with Pakistan, saying not playing the arch-rivals in the upcoming World Cup won’t have much of an impact on the Indian team’s campaign at the mega event in May-July.Days later, Sachin Tendulkar said he would ‘hate’ to give away two points to Pakistan by not playing in the World Cup and India should rather beat them again in the showpiece event to maintain their unbeaten record over the arch-rivals.“He wants two points against Pakistan, I want the World Cup so...he wants two points I want the World Cup. Whichever way you look at it,” Ganguly said, reacting to Tendulkar’s comments.Eden Gardens has photographs of Imran, Wasim Akram and others kept in non-public areas of the stadium.Former and current cricketers have expressed varied opinions on severing cricketing ties with Pakistan.Many ministers of West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee’s cabinet, including former Bengal captain Lakshmi Ratna Shukla, hit out at BJP for trying to divert nation’s attention from terrorism.“We are more keen on removing terrorism from the world rather than pulling down photographs (of sportspersons). The BJP is trying to divert the attention from the current issue of terror attack. This is clear politics going on in the country,” Shukla said.State Municipal minister and city mayor Firhad Hakim when contacted said people should not confuse politics with sports and culture.Former cricketer and current Bengal coach Arun Lal said that the country was going through an emotional time and countrymen were venting out their feelings in different ways.“I can understand the feelings of my countrymen. I also share the same. This is a very emotional time. We have lost some of our brave brothers and obviously the country is hurt.

I have a good news for you all. The AAP government has covered your medical and social security needs by allocating Rs 50 crore in our budget, which will be presented next week. The allocation will be in effect from April 1,” he said.The CM said this amount was not a one-time fund and that it would be an annual allocation, which is likely to increase year on year.In a second sop to the lawyers, Kejriwal promised that after the Lok Sabha elections, the Delhi government would direct the Delhi Electricity Regulatory Commission (DERC) to permanently change electricity connections of their chambers from commercial to domestic.“This will help you save a lot on your electricity bills. The Delhi government has been giving Rs 230 crore as subsidy to lawyers at present to match the difference. Once DERC makes this change in its tariff order after elections, then this subsidy will not be required,” he said.Kejriwal appealed to the lawyers to vote for AAP in the upcoming general elections so that Delhi could get the full statehood status.“Make us win on all seven seats, we will give full statehood to Delhi. We will raise the matter in Parliament. The powers we enjoy now is not even 10% of what Sheila Dikshit used to enjoy in her 15-year rule in Delhi. Now, I being the CM cannot even appoint my own peon,” he said.",0

However, intelligence sources said that explosives, safety fuses, aluminium electric detonators and cords have been found at some of the shut quarries in south Kashmir. “We don’t want to leave anything to chance. It’s not easy to carry RDX, or any explosive material, in a huge amount in a car in a single day. We want to eliminate the possibility of the role of any local mining quarry in keeping the explosives at a safe place,” said a senior J&K intelligence official. Officials believe that the Jaish terrorist could not have brought the entire cache of explosives at one go and was certainly provided logistic support of these business units. Sleuths have also launched a manhunt for stolen vehicles reported between January first week and February 14 following the uncertainty over the make and model of the car used in the attack. Both NIA and J&K Police sleuths have been divided over the car model, whether it was a Maruti Eeco or Ford Ecosport. Did Pulwama suicide bomber hide explosives in stone quarry? PULWAMA/SRINAGAR: Intelligence sleuths across security establishments in Jammu and Kashmir will now be preparing a list of stone quarries that had got shut in south Kashmir in the last few months amid suspicion that Pulwama suicide bomber Adil Ahmad Dar may have hidden explosives in one of these units. Sources in intelligence agencies said while it was likely that the Jaish-e-Mohammad terrorist had used imported military grade RDX from Pakistan in the IED used in the February 14 Pulwama attack, the sophisticated gadgetry could have been provided at one of the local quarries. There are about 30-odd quarries in south Kashmir, including in Pulwama, Anantnag and Shopian. These quarries often use illegally procured explosives and detonators.

451,"Don't mind losing my job, says TrivediRailway minister Dinesh Trivedi had promised a “revolutionary” rail budget to some of his cabinet colleagues on Tuesday. But his party chief Mamata Banerjee smelled a “rebellion” in Trivedi’s budget instead after he hiked passenger fare—allegedly keeping her in the dark—and left him with two options: roll back the hike or quit.For the first time in the history of parliament, the railway minister’s own party opposed the budget and left him in the lurch. Many in the party believe, Trivedi will have to make a quick choice as Mamata Banerjee ruled out any compromise on her “pro-people” stand.Trivedi, however, tried to put a brave face: “I have done my work as the railway minister. Now I leave the rest to the God.”Although fares have been raised across all sections, a roll back in the suburban (2 paise per km), second class (3 paise per km) and sleeper class (5 paise per km) may mollify the Trinamool chief, sources close to her told HT. Banerjee reportedly sees these fare tweaks as anti-poor and anti-aam aadmi.If Trivedi refuses to roll-back and puts in papers before the rail budget is passed, that would be another unprecedented event in parliament’s history. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh will then have to steer the budget till its passage. The option of asking Trivedi to continue till the passing of the budget also remains with the PM. However, Mamata Banerjee may not agree to such arrangement. Poll: Is it time for Cong to part ways with Mamata?A furious Trinamool chief Mamata Banerjee, who had repeatedly warned Trivedi against tinkering with passenger fares in the run-up to the budget, claimed that the railway minister did not consult the party before raising the fares. There was no direct communication between the railway minister and his political boss“As railway minister, he has the right to take own budget decisions. But the fare hike is totally against the policies of Mamata Banerjee and the party,” Trinamool’s parliamentary party chief Sudip Bandopadhyay told HT after a livid Banerjee called him from Nandigram area of West Bengal and vented her ire.Banerjee’s temper reportedly further soared at Trivedi’s praises for the finance ministry. Railway ministry got a loan of Rs 3000 crore from the government to tide over its immediate financial crunch.“Trivedi may shower lofty praises on the finance ministry but that ministry has offered no help to make West Bengal a financially stable state.”Trying to bring the Indian railway back on track, Dinesh Trivedi gets derailed in Trinamool’s political tracks.",1
452,"Drunk drivers are a Delhi policeman’s nightmareDelhi Traffic Police officers say that “hostility” from drunk drivers is one of many reasons why just over 100 motorists were prosecuted for the offence everyday on an average last year in the national capital.Traffic police personnel in the national capital say they are frequently threatened, sometimes assaulted or even mowed down by motorists when they attempt to prosecute drunk driving.(HT?File )“Blow into the alcometer,” the traffic policeman’s order was loud and clear. The SUV driver pretended to blow, but actually held his breath towards the end. The policeman knew just how to deal with the situation. “Loudly count till 10,” was the next command.In the next few seconds, the policeman had scientific evidence of the motorist having 105 mg of alcohol per 100 ml of blood, more than thrice the permissible limit. But what followed next was just what the policeman at the picket near Connaught Place fears every evening.The policeman had to fight off threats of action and repeated phone calls asking him to let go of the driver.This was a relatively much easier situation for the policeman to handle.Traffic police personnel in the national capital say they are frequently threatened, sometimes assaulted or even mowed down by motorists when they attempt to prosecute drunk driving.On better days, a motorist snatches away their alcometer as was seen at Barakhamba Road last November.Traffic Police officers say that “hostility” from drunk drivers is one of many reasons why just over 100 motorists were prosecuted for the offence everyday on an average last year in the national capital.The 37,188 prosecutions for drunk driving in 2018 were 11% more than the 33,343 previous year, but road safety experts say these figures are just the “tip of an iceberg”.“The drunk driving checking is not as frequent and widespread given how rampant the menace is in Delhi. A driver’s judgement is badly impaired after drinking and he is just lucky to reach his destination without harming anyone,” says Piyush Tewari, founder of NGO SafeLife Foundation.As per a study in America, an increase of Blood Alcohol Concentration by 0.02% doubles the relative risk of a vehicle crash among 16-20 year old males. That risk increases to 52 times when the BAC is between 0.08% and 0.10%.In India, motorists are not allowed to drive if the alcohol content is found to be over 30 milligrams per 100 millilitres of blood.According to a late last year’s survey of 5,000 Delhi motorists who drink, 3,605 (72.1%) of them admitted to drinking after driving. The survey, which was conducted by NGO ‘Community Against Drunken Driving’, found that 1,768 of those drivers said they regularly took to the wheel after drinking while 1,837 said they drove under the influence of alcohol only occasionally.More importantly, 78.6% of the respondents said they were not checked for drunk driving in the last six months of the survey.“The enforcement agencies do not take the issue as seriously as it should be. They view it as a seasonal traffic offence which happens during festivals like Holi, Diwali and new years,” says Prince Singhal, the NGO’s founder.According to the 2017 data put out by the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways, drunk driving caused 124 mishaps in Delhi and left 24 people dead and 126 injured. Across the country, drunk driving was the reason for 14,071 mishaps which killed 4,776 people and injured 11,776.But Tewari dismisses the data saying that most drunk drivers get away after causing an accident, leaving investigators clueless about the condition of the driver.“Delhi is a hub of hit and run cases. Many motorists abandon their vehicles after a mishap. When they are caught after a day or two, there is no evidence of drunk driving,” says Tewari.The act of fleeing after a mishap or fighting with the police after getting caught for drunk driving arises from the relatively tough penalties for drunken driving, says Alok Kumar, joint commissioner of police (Delhi Traffic Police).“Drunk driving is one of five traffic violations which lead to seizure of driving license for three months. No motorist wants to part with their license. I haven’t heard of one drunk driver who accepted the penalties without fighting with the traffic police on duty,” says Kumar.What also scares the motorists is the possible arrest and imprisonment up to six months, impounding of their vehicles and penalty of Rs 2,000. “The repeat offenders are the ones who are usually the most aggressive because they can be jailed up to three years and fined Rs 3,000,” says JCP Kumar.Out on the roads, the traffic police officers say they not only face a host of excuses and tricks by offenders, but also violent behaviour that risks the lives of the general public.“Each of these drunk drivers knows some influential person or the other. It becomes very uncomfortable for us to fend them off. In case the driver doesn’t know someone who can bail him out, he will try to take a U-turn or speed away, without bothering about its consequences,” says a traffic police inspector in west Delhi’s Rajouri Garden.JCP Kumar says that after drinking most drivers have a “false sense of bravado” and believe they can drive better.The CADD study found that one in every four of its respondents believed they drive better after drinking.",0
453,"Dubai-bound plane hijacker had issues with wife, wanted to speak to Bangladesh PM:?OfficialsBangladeshi commandoes shot a passenger on Sunday who had tried to enter the cockpit of a Biman Bangladesh Airlines flight after waving a gun and threatening to blow up the plane, airline and aviation authority officials said.The passenger, who had said he had a personal issue with his wife and told the pilot he wanted to speak to Bangladesh’s Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, died later from the injuries suffered after the commandos stormed the plane at Chittagong’s Shah Amanat International Airport, officials said.“We tried to arrest him or get him to surrender but he refused and then we shot him,” said Major General S M Motiur Rahman of the Bangladesh Army.The man’s threat to blow up the plane, which was on its way to Dubai from Dhaka via Chittagong, led its pilots to make an emergency landing.Before the commandos moved in, all 142 passengers and most of the crew had been let off the aircraft unharmed. One crew member had been held hostage, the officials said.Air Vice Marshal Nayeem Hasan, chairman of the Civil Aviation Authority of Bangladesh, told reporters at a news conference that as well as holding what appeared to be a pistol the passenger said he had explosives bound to his body.With the plane close to Chittagong after leaving Dhaka, the passenger stood up from his seat and tried to go to the cockpit, according to aviation officials. When a member of the crew blocked his way, he showed his pistol.He then said he had explosives and if they didn’t open the door of the cockpit he would blow up the plane, officials said. Other members of the crew alerted the pilots to the problem and they asked air traffic control for an emergency landing.It was not immediately clear if he had explosives, though the pistol was real, according to a senior aviation official. It also wasn’t immediately clear if the pistol was loaded or how it got through security at the airport in Dhaka.The security questions are a matter of concern and would be the subject of an investigation, said the aviation official.The man appeared to be in his 20s, and was probably Bangladeshi as he was speaking Bangla, but his identity was not yet clear, Hasan said.",0
454,"Ease in procuring licences makes Delhi’s roads dangerousOut of 10 major cities, Delhi stood sixth in the list of drivers who had procured a licence without taking a test.There are 1,200 unauthorised motor training institutes in Delhi, a plea in Delhi High Court said.(HT?File )Overtaking from the wrong side, inching bumper-to-bumper with the car in front and wrongly navigating the city’s roundabouts — Delhi’s drivers have a lot to learn when it comes to safe driving practices.But if these basic rules were largely ignored, then how did these drivers get their licences?The Delhi government has of late started a major crackdown against the growing corruption in regional transport offices by launching dedicated helplines to report cases of corruption. The ease in procuring drivers’ licences in the city, however, was an issue that was ignored for years.This resulted in the growth of untrained drivers who know little about the rules to be followed once they are behind the wheels.Till very recently, touts who offered to even appear in tests on your behalf for a meagre payment of Rs 3,000-Rs 4,000, were a regular sight at transport offices.“We have a no-tolerance policy for touts who take bribes and offer to issue licences. We conduct regular inspections and have also put up boards for the awareness of people to report such activities,” said Delhi’s transport minister Kailash Gahlot.Startling figuresData released by the Union ministry of road transport and highways (MoRTH) showed that in 2017, around 80% of road accidents in India was caused by valid licence holders.A 2018 survey by road safety NGO SaveLife Foundation also corroborated this dangerous trend. Data showed that 59% driving licence holders in India never took a test and thus did not completely understand road safety rules.Delhi did not fare too well in this test either.Out of 10 major cities, Delhi stood sixth in the list of drivers who had procured a licence without taking a test. At least 54% of Delhiites, compared to the national average of 59%, claimed to have not taken the competency test while applying for their licences.Unauthorised driving schoolsA plea filed in Delhi High Court last year had sought action against around 1,200 unauthorised motor training institutes that had mushroomed in the national capital.The classes imparted by these private schools are usually spread over 15 days and comprise six to seven hours of training and charge anywhere between Rs 1,800 and Rs 2,500.A student, who may have never sat in the driver’s seat, is directly ushered onto the busy and dangerous roads of the city on the first day of the class.“There is nothing to worry. We have full control of the vehicle,” says Hari Lal, a 37-year-old trainer at a driving school in west Delhi.By mentioning control, Lal was referring to an additional set of brakes and clutch fitted into the passenger’s side of the car.“There is no chance of an accident. I’ll apply brakes the moment a student loses control of the steering,” he adds.Many students say they feel confident while being trained, but are clueless while taking their own vehicles on the roads later.“I was caught in a massive jam and just didn’t know how to negotiate my way out. I had to seek the help of another motorist to get out of the situation,” said Deepa Vijay, who was trained by an unauthorised school.Nitin Kumar, an IT professional, said he found the training imparted to be inadequate. “I had to go through the training a second time because I wasn’t taught how to reverse, how to do parallel parking, how to shift lanes or the right use of mirrors,” said Kumar.Kumar said he was never taught how to drive a car on a flyover in busy traffic. “There were many important instructions I never received. I took to YouTube videos to learn important things myself,” said Kumar.But Girish Sharma, president of All India Motor Driving School Association, believes that those trained by even the unauthorised schools are better than those who learn by themselves or are trained by family or friends. He said that barely 10% of all motorists seek training from driving schools.“The trainers are mostly those who quit authorised driving schools or are awaiting licence. They teach their students about road signs, how to handle practical situations, to ensure there is no one in front of or behind the car when they switch start a car,” said Sharma, adding that even the unauthorised school trainers did more good than bad.But Sharma said it was necessary that only authorised motor driving training schools were allowed to operate so that only properly trained people were allowed to teach others.Many learners said that these trainers also doubled up as agents who promised to help them get driving licences easily. “I have to attend the driving test, but I have been assured that I will pass, no matter my performance,” said a learner, who didn’t want to identify himself.Tougher tests and uniform licensingFrom July this year, all states will have to issue uniform licences with security features, which will allow police and security agency to access driver information on the spot. Road safety experts, however, said that the need of the hour is to fix the process of licence procurement.“The process of driver tests needs to be made more transparent. Learners’ tests need to ensure that the applicant knows the basic rules of driving before they hit the road,” said Madhumita Deshpandey, co-founder of Road Safety Records, a Delhi-based research organisation, which focuses on road infrastructure and safety.Recently, Delhi introduced a one-of-a-kind automated track test centre in Sarai Kale Khan. The centre makes getting a drivers’ licence difficult by stimulating tougher driving conditions.Experts also said that certifying driving trainers under government rules will also help ensure the training is up to the mark. In several cities in the US, retired police officials take up the task of training new drivers to ensure that the theory of driving is also mastered.",0
455,"Eight killed in 12-vehicle pile-up on Rohtak highwaySeveral accidents were reported from highways in the Gangetic plains which was covered by dense fog on Monday morning, reducing the visibility to bare minimum.Eight persons, including seven women, were killed in a vehicle pile-up due to dense fog on the Rohtak-Rewari highway in Haryana on Monday, police said. At least 10 others were injured in the accident that took place in Jhajjar district in which over 12 vehicles, including a school bus, were involved, they said.Several accidents were reported from highways in the Gangetic plains which was covered by dense fog on Monday morning, reducing the visibility to bare minimum. Former state health minister Satyanarayan Lathar was killed in Jind after an unidentified vehicle hit him when he was walking home from his petrol pump late on Sunday night, police said.According to police, all the victims in the Jhajjar accident were from Kirdodh village and were going to Najafgarh in Delhi in a jeep to condole the death of a relative there. The jeep collided with a pick-up vehicle and was hit by a speeding truck from behind, police said, adding that the injured were taken to Pt BD Sharma Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences in Rohtak.“Eight persons were killed in the accident that took place in the early morning. At least 12 vehicles were involved in the pile-up,” said Seema Devi, station house officer, Jhajjar police station.The pile-up occurred after the two vehicles collided on Badli Flyover on National Highway-71 and around 10 more piled up behind them due to poor visibility, leading to more injuries. There was a school bus involved in the accident, which led to a two-kilometre traffic jam, but none of the passengers was injured, police said.Seven women and one man who were sitting in the back of the jeep were killed, while two more sitting in the same vehicle were critically injured. The deceased have been identified as Satpal Kumar (48), his wife Kanta Devi (40), Santosh Devi (52), Prem Lata (50), Laxmi Devi (63), Ram Kali (35), Sheela Devi (61) and Khajani Devi (54). They were cremated in the village Monday afternoon amid a pall of gloom.“A woman in Satpal’s relation had died in Najafgarh, for which the entire family was going there to pay our condolence. The visibility was very poor due to fog. Only 20 minutes in journey, we were hit by a truck from behind and all this happened,” said Dheeraj, son of Santosh.The Haryana government has announced a compensation of Rs 2 lakh to the kin of the deceased. “Compensation of Rs 2 lakh will be given to the kin of the deceased, Rs 1 lakh to those severely injured and Rs 50,000 to those with minor injuries,” Haryana minister OP Dhankar said.The northern part of the country, including Haryana and Punjab, has been reeling under the cold wave for the past one week. “Cold weather combined with the availability of moisture will result in foggy conditions over Northwest India. This dense fog is likely to reduce visibility over Punjab, Haryana, North Rajasthan, Delhi and Uttar Pradesh, resulting in difficulty for commuters in the morning and noon hours,” stated Skymet, a private weather forecasting agency.Dense to very dense fog was observed at isolated places over Punjab and West Rajasthan and moderate fog at isolated places over Haryana, Chandigarh, Delhi and West Uttar Pradesh in the morning hours.

These were unserviceable anti-aircraft ammunition.On average, unserviceable ammunition has caused 65-70 accidents annually since 2013-2014.In May this year, an official of the Ordinance Factory died during a routine check of L-70 ammunition at a forward ammunition depot near Pathankot in Punjab. “The accident happened when a validation exercise for L-70 rounds was being carried. The round went off accidentally killing an OF official,” a senior army officer who didn’t want to be named said.Apart from ammunition for the L-70 guns, ammunition for tanks and Armoured Personnel Carriers are also a cause of concern for the Indian ArmyAs many as 19 personnel, including two officers, died when faulty anti-tank mines exploded at the Central Ammunition Depot in Phulgaon in May 2016. Surprisingly, while an internal inquiry pinned the blame on the Ordnance Factory and some of its officials, no was held accountable. Two officials found to be responsible by the inquiry have even superannuated, according to a second Ministry of Defence official who did not want to be named .An audit of faulty ammunition being done by the Department of Defence Production , which supervises the Ordnance Factory, was stopped following the death, this official added. “The Indian army has been promised an improved version of L-70 ammunition fuse next year by the Ordnance Factory Boards. The audit has restarted in July”.The issue is technology, a retired army officer said.“Ordnance factories have not been up to date with the technology upgrades; recently, Indian made ammunition for the newly procured M-777 Light Howitzers malfunctioned causing an accident. Ordinance factories must acquire new technology and maintain better hygiene,” Brigadier S Chatterjee (retd) said.Defence Ministry spokesperson, Colonel Aman Anand, did not respond to queries. Unserviceable ammunition isn’t the only concern for the Indian Army, Ordnance Factories have also consistently failed to produce adequate quantity of ammunition.“The present state of preparedness has created voids due to the limited production capacity of the Ordinance Factory and consistent slippage in production targets,” the Indian Army told a Parliamentary oversight committee on defence last year.Informing the Ministry of Defence and Parliamentary oversight committee, the Indian Army wrote, “Out of 22 items indented on Ordinance Factory Boards, as part of the Ammunition road map, 14 items were not supplied at all.”The Indian Army also asked for the accountability to be fixed on the Ordnance Factory Boards for “poor quality,” slippages” and delays in supply of ammunition.",0

The ministry has asked for a report for implementation of transfer policy for rotation of officials working in sensitive regions to enable vigilance directorate to put the information for the perusal of higher officials.“It is reiterated that all concerned may examine the feasibility of transferring the officials working on sensitive posts at the earliest and ensure that no incumbent dealing with sensitive work continues on any sensitive post beyond the stipulated period as advised to zonal railways from time to time,” said the directive issued by railways.This comes after the Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) issued a directive in August this year reiterating that all government departments should ensure rotational policy on sensitive posts. It further said that analysis of frauds in public sector banks and other organisations show that one of the reasons for such frauds was non-implementation of the rotation policy.             The CVC had asked that all departments strictly follow rotational transfer policy and heads of all departments should ensure implementation of the policy.In 2015, Member of Parliament N F Patole had complained to the railway’s ministry about some officials occupying sensitive posts for over 15-20 years and creating hurdles in the transparent functioning of various departments.

462,"From white jalebis to INS Vikrant, Naik’s memoir has it allIn a political career spanning over five decades, governor Ram Naik faced several interesting incidents that form a part of his memoir ‘Charaivati-Charaivati’ (Marching ahead, marching ahead) written in Marathi and now translated into Hindi, English, Urdu and Gujarati, which will be released by President Pranab Mukherjee at the Rashtrapati Bhawan in New Delhi on November 9.In Lucknow, his memoir would be released on November 11 in the presence of Union home minister Rajnath Singh and chief minister Akhilesh Yadav.In his labour of love, Naik has included interesting things he had to deal with right from rechristening Bombay to ‘Mumbai,’ use of edible colours in sweetmeats, preservation of INS Vikrant and even finding the Constitution of India written in Hindi on gold leaves!“As an MP, I was required to handle a plethora of diverse matters. One of them was prohibiting sweetmeat makers from using edible colours in their products. Union health minister AR Antulay was among my acquaintances. The makers argued that it would be more reasonable to order them to use only permitted food colours of specified quality. However, if the ban was implemented in toto, there would only be white sweets. Imagine eating white jalebis and pedhas,” said Naik.From sweetmeats to INS Vikrant, Naik quickly changes track and recalls how the INS Vikrant was declared a national monument but it had to be disposed off as a scrap due to the failure of Maharashtra and Central government in preserving the warship that helped India win the 1971 war against Pakistan.Recalling another interesting anecdote, the governor said how his initiative led to Bombay being rechristened as ‘Mumbai.’ And a simple query about the Hindi manuscript of the Constitution of India in the Parliament Library literally led him to the ‘golden book.’“While I was reading in the Parliament Library, I came across the original English edition of the Constitution. Curious, I asked to see the original Hindi edition of the Constitution. Quite an amusing tale unfolded from this simple query. The original Hindi edition was written down by Vasant Vaidya, a Maharashtra calligraphist. Gold plated pages were imported from Germany and a special kind of ink, used for writing this edition, was brought from a reputed firm in China. The writing instrument was a special pen, crafted by the famous Watkins Company, made in Washington State, USA. It had taken Vaidya a full year to complete the writing of the Constitution on the gold plated pages. The Hindi edition is decorated with sketches of Lord Shri Ram, Shri Krishna, Gautam Buddha, Rani of Jhansi and several personalities from our cultural and historic past.”Changing tracks once again, Naik while referring to his tenure as chairman of the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) says, “One of the major assignments of the PAC is to investigate in case of any dubious transaction made by various government agencies after they are recorded by the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG). I created a record by submitting eight reports of PAC in one year. The most sensational of these reports was about the misuse of official aircraft belonging to railway ministry by the then railway minister CK Jaffer Sharief.

One has to be sensitive towards them,” Rana tweeted after he was allotted an upper berth in Suhaildev Express on Sunday night.He posted a series of tweets to express his anguish.“Hum AIIMS me admit hone ke liye jaa rahe hain, 3 passengers me se 2 senior citizens hain, uske bawjood hume upper berth allot ki gayi...Kya senior citizens ko yahi facility milni chahiye?’ Rana tweeted tagging the railway ministry and railway minister Piyush Goel.In his second tweet, he also posted his PNR number and berth details.Rana said thankfully a co-passenger offered his own berth to make their journey comfortable.He was travelling with two other passengers – Munawwar Jafri, 68, and Adil Rasheed, 52 – on PNR number 2726069792 and boarded the train from Lucknow in AC-II.“Railways has to be more sensitive towards senior citizens. All three of us were given upper berth making a sheer mockery of our age,” said Rana.“We were clueless as to how to climb up the berth as our knees are not much supportive,” he said, adding it was insensitive on the part of railways which compelled them to plead for berths from co-passengers.“It’s not our age and stature to beg for berth. What do titles like ‘Saraswati Putra’ mean for us when railways don’t even have the courtesy to respect our age,” he said.Read moreSummer heat can be dangerous for the elderly. 6 tips to protect them65-year-old in Mumbai cheated of Rs17.67 lakh in insurance fraudChief public relations officer, Northern Railways (NR), Nitin Chowdhary said: “Berth allocation system is programmed in a manner to give priority to senior citizens and female passengers in allocation of lower berths. However, once the lower berths get reserved, there is no choice but to allocate upper berths.”“As per the allocation system in AC-II, there is a provision to allocate only three lower berths on first come, first serve basis.

464,"Govt mulls pvt role in rly, scrapping of fare subsidyScrapping the railway board, merging the rail budget with the main budget and withdrawing the passenger fare subsidy are among the radical reform proposals the government is considering, official sources said.Railways minister DV Sadananda Gowda is also contemplating a role for private stakeholders in policy-making and lateral entry for IAS officers into the top rail hierarchy to “de-centralise and corporatize” the functioning of the public transporter, which carries roughly 23 million passengers daily.“The railways served the nation well in the initial decades after Independence, but its administrative and institutional structure and functioning seems archaic and unscientific in the present context and needs overhaul. These tasks are huge and difficult and will need to be attempted progressively,” Rail Restructuring Committee chairman Bibek Debroy told HT.The committee was set up recently by the Indian Railways to take forward Gowda’s budget announcements on restructuring the rail ministry and railway board.All these reform proposals have been mentioned in the reports of several expert committees.A top government priority is to replace the “outdated and flexible” accounting practices with a professional “corporate accounting” system that can provide scientific data on the profits and losses of rail operations, the sources said.“The railways must eventually work towards… charging passenger fares commensurate with expenses incurred in providing for the cost of travel. But the progressive hike in fares will also have to be matched with better passenger amenities,” Debroy said.Currently, passenger fares are hugely subsidized, resulting in an annual loss of Rs. 25,000 crore in this segment. A proposal to merge the railways’ nine different cadre and provide for a single, unified cadre — to be called the Indian Railway Service — is also part of the surgical operation plan.",1
465,"Green patches, seats at regular intervals increase walkability quotientWhile on the one hand, Delhi has some of the most beautiful and pedestrian-friendly roads such as Sardar Patel Marg or Kasturba Gandhi Marg, it also has stretches such as the one between ISBT Kashmere Gate and Majnu Ka Tilla, where pedestrians are forced to walk on the main roads and risk their lives due to the lack of walkable footpath.Experts say greenery should be maintained round the year to make footpaths walkable. (Amal KS/HT Photo )Mention the word ‘walkability’ and it immediately conjures up an image of a foreign city such as Paris and London — with people walking on wide footpaths adorned with lush green trees and hedges, seats at regular intervals and colourful shops and eateries along the way. But a careful glance at our city will tell you that Delhi doesn’t have to look beyond its territory to understand what the term entails.While on the one hand, Delhi has some of the most beautiful and pedestrian-friendly roads such as Sardar Patel Marg or Kasturba Gandhi Marg with their canopy of trees, broad sideways with well-laid green patches, on the other hand, it also has stretches such as the one between ISBT Kashmere Gate and Majnu Ka Tilla, where pedestrians are forced to walk on the main roads and risk their lives due to the lack of walkable footpath.Elaborating on the issue, architect and urban planner, AGK Menon, said, “A walkable road needs proper planning and integration of greenery, aesthetics, safety and public utility right from the planning stages. But unfortunately, most roads in the city sans the ones in Lutyens’ Delhi lack this. Sometimes, you see a bus stop right in the middle of the footpath, sometimes, there are no trees to provide pedestrians with shade, and at times, the footpaths are dug up.”But then, one might ask, what does greenery have to do with walkability.The connectionA study conducted by the Delhi Traffic Police in 2016 revealed that road accidents in the New Delhi area — which has massive green coverage and continuous walking facilities for pedestrians — was at least 40 per cent lower than the rest of the city. It also showed that pedestrian deaths in accidents in this area were almost 85 per cent lower.The connection between green coverage and road accidents was first established by the government of Mexico City in 2015, which assessed some of the busiest and the most accident-prone stretches, for over a decade and increased the green coverage there. After the project was completed, it was seen that not only were accidents on the stretch controlled but also that incidents of road rage among drivers had gone down.In a statement released to the local media, the Mexico City government had said the green cover “had acted as a stress buster for drivers” who were otherwise more aggressive on roads. This, they said, became a boon for pedestrians, who had also found the newly developed area more accessible.“Greenery along sideways and footpaths not just provides shade and increases your convenience while walking, it also soothes your senses and keeps you happy and calm. The moment you start walking with your senses feeling the surrounding, it slows you down and acts as a recreation for you. The hedges along edges of footpaths keep you from getting down on the roads, thereby bringing down the chances of accidents,” said KT Ravindran, urban designer and former chairman of the Delhi Urban Art Commission.Curbing pollution woesThere are umpteen studies that have revealed how greenery along roads and footpaths could help bring down pollution. A latest study by researchers from the University of Surrey has shown that hedges can bring down vehicular pollution by more than 60 per cent.In 2009, the Indian Road Congress (IRC) had laid down certain guidelines and objectives that need to be followed while selecting plants.“The objectives while selecting a plant species — as laid down in the IRC — are to reduce air and dust pollution, arrest soil erosion, mitigate extreme climatic conditions, reduce noise pollution, among others. But these are hardly followed in plantation drives,” RNS Tyagi, former horticulture director of the Central Public Works Department, said.Experts said a mix-and-match of big canopy trees and hedges are ideal for footpaths. It, in fact, make roads more walkable.“Just like we need woods and greenery, we also need open spaces. Both are important for us. And for this, we need a proper plan. We can’t just go on planting trees just for the sake of greenery,” author and conservationist, Pradip Krishen, said.Moving aheadSo how exactly do we go ahead? Experts said that to integrate greenery with roads so that they could become more walkable should be the primary objective among planners right from the initial stages.“A major criterion while making a city or its roads walkable is to see that the walkbale streets do not end abruptly. They should have some continuity and end in open spaces such as a park,” said Ravindran.Planners also said the more interactive a footpath -- with lots of greenery instead of a mundane looking road with ‘dead’ walls — the more it will increase walkability.“If the road has spaces with greenery, shops and eateries, which a pedestrian can see, walkabilty increases. A dull road with walls blocking your sight reduces the walkability quotient,” Ravindran maintained.But just planting trees and hedges won’t help. Experts said that in an attempt to make roads and footpaths more walkable, greenery should be maintained round the year. Unless maintained, these green stretches could become shady dark places and become unsafe.“Whenever we think of widening a road or coming up with an infrastructure project, the first thing we see is that trees are chopped off. Sometimes, when footpaths are retrofitted, the bases of trees are all concretised despite a National Green Tribunal (NGT) ruling against such practices. Residents should be involved so that greeneries could be maintained more efficiently,” said Kanchi Kohli, legal researcher at Centre for Policy Research.",0

My eight-year-old son played with snow throughout the way.”Groom along with his family treks to Makku Math in Rudraprayag district for his wedding ceremony after roads were blocked due to heavy snow. (HT Photo)A wedding ceremony with only 25 people is rare in Uttarakhand, but one such wedding took place on Friday at Makku Math in Rudraprayag after the groom along with his relatives walked for over 6km in heavy snow to attend the ceremony.Around 80 people had left for from Triyuginarayan village in the district to attend Rajnish Kurmachali’s wedding ceremony at Makku Math, but were stuck in traffic after vehicular roads were closed due to snow. The family then decided to send only those people who were needed for the rituals such as the groom’s maternal uncle, sisters and some elderly people. The dolled up family undertook a 6km long unique marriage procession, with children playing in the snow to reach their destination.“We had seen a wedding procession like this in 2002 and now this was the next one. People will talk about this procession and the wedding for years as in both the weddings the groom was an army jawan,” said Ashish Gairola, the groom’s brother.Speaking on whether the journey was difficult for the family, Gairola said, “If you see the pictures then you would question whether they were even feeling cold, forget difficulty. My eight-year-old son played with snow throughout the way.”Since the last seven days, the village has not received power supply, making it difficult for them to carry out daily chores. The groom’s brother added that people have been charging their phone batteries through their cars due to power outage.Bijay Lal, head of Triyuginarayan village said, “Even I had to go to the wedding but were all stuck due to the snow. But those who went enjoyed the whole journey and the wedding took place without any problem.”Mangesh Ghildilyal, district magistrate of Rudraprayag said, ""We received information about this wedding where people had to walk all the way. It is good that they walked, as due to continuous snowfall, there are high chances of accident as cars can skid."" He added that machines have been deployed to clear the snow in the village but due to incessant snowfall the roads are still blocked.",0

In an exclusive interview with HT, Nishant threw light on what makes the show stand out from others, why it’s tough to work in the television industry and more.Actor Nishant Malkani is 31 and portrays the role of a father to three grown up men on TV show Guddan Tumse Na Ho Payega. With no grey hair in sight, the actor is seen as the husband of 20-year-old Guddan who owns the title of India’s youngest mother-in-law. In an exclusive interview with HT, Nishant threw light on what makes the show stand out from others, why it’s tough to work in the television industry and more. Excerpts:Tell us more about the show Guddan Tumse Na Ho Payega.The story is about a man and a woman who meet accidently and go on to tie the knot. Both of them are poles apart. While the woman is around 20 years old, the man is in his mid-thirties. The woman is very innocent and even though she has good intentions, she ends up screwing everything. On the other hand, this man is very mature but is still in love with his first wife. They get married accidently due to unexpected circumstances. This man is the adopted son of the family and ends up being a father to three sons and a father-in-law to their wives. So when he marries Guddan, she ends up becoming their mother-in-law as well (as told in the show’s tagline – Guddan India ki youngest saas hain).You play a father to three grown up men in the show. Were you not apprehensive about playing such a role?Initially, I was apprehensive but the makers convinced me about the theme of the show. They were not going to give me grey hair or make me look older. They told me how a lot of twists and turns were going to come in the story and that I was not their real father. What’s interesting about this character was that while he is an angry young man in front of everyone, he was a very chilled out and loud person in the company of his former wife. This is a man who will show his anger even when he is in a romantic mood.Taking a time leap is a common trend on Indian TV shows. If the makers take a time leap of 20 years, will you be ready to play a 50-60 year old on screen?I will be apprehensive but it completely depends on why and how they will justify the time leap. If I find it interesting, I will do it and if I won’t, I will step back.How do you bond with your team?We have a very good team, all of us are very good friends. We have a house party at one of the people’s houses on an off day. We bond like college friends when not working.You have also done a few films.My last film was Bezubaan Ishq in 2016. I do have plans to do films but I am committed for 25 days in a month for this show. As long as I am shooting for this one, I won’t be able to take out time for other things. But after that, I will pick up whatever interesting comes my way. It can be anything – a film, a web series or another TV show. Right now, all three platforms are doing so well that as an actor, there is a lot of scope for anyone to grow.What is the major difference between the television industry and Bollywood?In films, you have a bound script, you know the entire graph of the character and his journey from end to finish. In a television show, everything changes every week. The TRPs decide what works and what doesn’t work and what we are going to do with the story. If the character is not working, we change the character, if not the actor. As an actor, one has to be very flexible to adapt all the time. If the show goes on for a year, you have to come on the screen everyday but yet do something different to keep the audience hooked. I believe shooting a film is much easier than a TV show.",0

After a slump in tourism due to the killing of Hizbul Mujahideen commander Burhan Wani in July 2016, it took frequent spells of snow in January this year to bring large number of foreign tourists to Kashmir amid militancy.The good start to the tourist season of 2019 comes after the industry took a downturn in 2018, a year which witnessed military offensive. Over 8.5 lakh tourists including 50,000 foreigners visited the Valley in 2018 as compared to 11 lakh in 2017. Tourism director Nisar Wani said ,“We received 25,095 tourists across Kashmir in January this year, including 2,480 foreigners,” Wani said.The arrival of foreign tourists has seen a surge. The figure was 1,405 in 2016, 1,170 in 2017, 2,369 in 2018 and 2,480 in 2019. Domestic tourists in January 2018 were 49,000. Wani said domestic arrival was affected as national highway closed due to snowfall for 12 days in January. “The highway closure also increased the price of air tickets exponentially. However, we continue to see more tourists. On February 3, 2019, we saw the highest daily arrival of 1,400,” he added.A chance discovery for someTourists enjoy skiing and heli-skiing on the slopes of Gulmarg.Rob, 32, an Australian did not know that there was a place Gulmarg in India. He said he came to know about the ski resort by accident on internet as it was snowing in the area. “I was stunned when I reached here on January 22,” he said. Rob has decided to stay here for a month and do what he likes the most – snowboarding.“I first visited Manali and then stumbled upon this place. I am happy that I did. The experience here has been beyond my imagination. This is the best place for skiing and snowboarding,” said Rob.Rob, an Australian, loves snowboarding and said he discovered about Gulmarg by accident on Internet.

The last day for the ministry and the board to file its responses is May 18.Kumar’s lawyer Pankaj Sinha, himself visually challenged, submitted before a bench headed by Chief Justice Dipak Misra and Justice Sanjiv Khanna that “the differentiation was uncalled for.”The Railways justified the denial of e-ticketing facility, saying the electronic reservation slip could be misused by general public by making false claims of disability.But the court prima-facie found the argument untenable.

472,"Henkel goes vegan to revive beauty businessGerman consumer goods company Henkel announced new hair care formulations and brands on Thursday, seeking to tap into consumer demand for more natural ingredients as it tries to revive sluggish growth in its beauty business.Henkel will relaunch its European shampoo brand Schauma with a “vegan” formula, roll out to more markets its Nature Box line of hair and body care products made from cold-pressed oils and launch a new “free-from” hair dye line called OnlyLove.It will also launch a premium vegan brand for professional hair salons called Authentic Beauty Concept and expand its Pro Nature range of cleaning products to include detergents.The move comes as shoppers become more wary of processed chemical ingredients and seek out natural alternatives.Chief Executive Hans van Bylen told a news conference the products certified as vegan will initially address a niche market, but he sees strong potential and said the move will eventually help the company adjust all of its formulations.“The increasing shift towards a green lifestyle and the strong increase in the number of vegans has driven the growing demand for plant-derived ingredients in beauty products,” said Magda Starula, analyst at market data firm Euromonitor.The world’s biggest cosmetics manufacturer L’Oreal bought vegan beauty product firm Logocos Naturkosmetik last year and it has launched its own vegan range, Botanea, sourced from plants found in India.Unilever has also launched a fast-growing hair and body brand called Love Beauty and Planet, that is certified as vegan and cruelty-free.Henkel said the Schauma brand’s vegan formula will not contain silicones or parabens, while the Authentic Beauty Concept line will include “pure” ingredients.Henkel, the maker of Schwarzkopf shampoo and Persil detergent, made the announcement after warning in January that earnings would fall this year as it steps up investment in brands and digital technology to try to revive growth.The company has underperformed rivals like Procter & Gamble Co (P&G) and Unilever in recent years, with underlying sales in its beauty care business falling 0.7 percent in 2018 and the laundry unit growing just 1.9 percent.Henkel’s beauty care unit saw organic sales growth recover to 1 percent in the fourth quarter, but it still lagged behind adhesives and laundry, which grew 2.1 percent and 2.8 percent respectively in the period.Van Bylen said Henkel plans a global relaunch of its Persil brand, with new “four-chamber” detergent pods key to reviving growth in North America, where it is battling P&G for market share.",0
473,"High court admits plea against RPF personnelThe Bombay high court on Thursday admitted a public interest litigation (PIL) which sought a probe by Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) in an alleged scam run by Railway Police Force (RPF) of booking petty offenders in railway offences and then releasing them on fake bail bonds.Observing that prima facie offence was made out against RPF personnel, a division bench of justice BH Marlapalle and justice UD Salvi admitted the petition.The court has also issued notices to the Ministry of Railway and Ministry of Home, Government of India, asking them to file affidavit explaining their stand towards investigation against RPF officials.Public prosecutor Pandurang Pol submitted an affidavit filed by commissioner of police, Railways, which said that their “investigation revealed that offence was committed by RPF personnel on duty Thane Kurla in 2008-09 by using fake bail bonds and false documents and misappropriating the money collected from commuters after charging them with relevant sections under the Railways Act”.Pol also told the court that a special investigation team was formed to probe the alleged scam.The petition was filed by social activist Samir Zaveri alleging a scam relating to cash bonds issued by the RPF personnel at Kurla railway station in 2008-09.It claimed that certain RPF personnel were releasing persons booked for trespassing on fake cash bail bonds. They then asked the commuters to pay Rs 500 bail bonds each in fake courts staged by them. Track trespassing is an offence under section 147 of the Indian Railway Act.

474,"How an illiterate rickshaw-puller became a mascot for educationAhmed Ali from Assam’s Karimganj district, while pulling his cycle rickshaw one day in the late 1970s, felt miserable at the realization that like him his soon-to-be-born child too will remain illiterate.Ahmed Ali from Assam’s Karimganj district, while pulling his cycle rickshaw one day in the late 1970s, felt miserable at the realization that like him his soon-to-be-born child too will remain illiterate and may have to pull a rickshaw for a living.Hailing from Madhurband village, when Ali, now 82, moved to Karimganj town, about 300 km from Guwahati, he often saw children attending school and getting educated, and sometimes even ferried them to and from their homes to their schools in his rickshaw.The thought of his child not getting proper education hit him so hard that he decided he should do something about it so that poor children of the coming generation, including his own, do not suffer in privation like him.Since then, Ali has gone on to build nine schools and, because of his singular effort, he even found a mention in Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ‘Mann Ki Baat’ radio programme.“I feel it was Allah’s wish and blessings from locals that I could achieve whatever I wanted,” says a humble Ali.“I could not attend school due to poverty. People of my village were poor and it pained me to see the children there were not able to attend schools due to the same reason. I don’t want to see dropouts from poor families any more,” Ali told IANS during a function in Delhi where he was invited as a guest.For establishing the first school, he sold a portion of his land and donated another portion on which the building now stands. The funds for the schools were also arranged by him from his savings, daily earnings and some from charity.“There were some people in the area who supported the cause and helped in whatever way they could,” he said.To ensure there was no fund crisis for the school, he used to pull his rickshaw in the morning and cut wood at night. He sold that wood and used the money to build the school and later to run it.“There was not even a single school in the area. I had this very strong feeling that when my children will be born, they too will not have any school. After the birth of my first child (a boy), the feeling became more strong,” he said.The school, he added, was even more important for girls as “boys get a chance to go out and get an education, but girls do not”.With a firm resolve that he should do something about it, Ali met an education officer, whom he used to ferry in his rickshaw, and with his help, he established a middle school in his village in 1978.“Soon after it was established, I realised that first, we needed a primary school. Until children were educated at the primary level, who will get enrolled in middle school? In 1980, three-LP (Lower Primary) schools were opened,” he said.In all, Ali has opened three lower primary (class I-V) schools, five middle (class VI-VIII) schools and one high school in Madhurband and nearby villages.“Education is an important thing, and everyone should get a chance to get educated. It is a sin for anybody to not be educated,” he said.“Although I may be illiterate, I get respect from people. They now come to seek my blessings. I feel joy when I see that boys and girls from the village have been attending school. This joy inspired me and I never felt tired,” said Ali.“I get satisfaction when girls come and tell me how helpful these schools were for them. Every year, the overall number of girls in schools is higher than boys.”The high school, started in 1990, has 228 students in the current year. Every year, hundreds of students appear for the Class X exams, but they don’t have a place to study further.“I could only manage to make arrangements for students till Class X. They don’t have a place to study Class XI and XII. I need both the government’s approval and funds for setting up the higher-secondary school,” Ali said, in the hope that he will soon accomplish that as well.“There is no nearby college. The nearest college is also 15 km away. I also want to build a college for students, but that will come at a later stage. First we need a junior college (for students passing Class X),” he added.Ali came to limelight in March last year when Prime Minister Modi spoke about him in his monthly “Mann Ki Baat” address.Ali feels proud that the Prime Minister acknowledged his work and he desires to meet Modi.Asked what he will tell Modi, Ali said he wanted all that the schools should be government-recognised so that funds were never an issue. “I will also ask him for a junior college and a college, if possible.”",0
475,"How Kim Jong un went from pariah to guest of honorKim Jong Un’s arrival in Vietnam by train this week for a second meeting with US President Donald Trump may be most remarkable for how normal it’s becoming.Since opening talks with South Korea last year, the once-reclusive North Korean leader has turned into one of the most sought-after guests in Asia. At each stop -- from Beijing to Singapore and now Hanoi -- Kim, 35, is being escorted down red carpets by officials eager to build early ties with the head of one of the world’s last untapped emerging markets.The swing from international pariah to guest of honor is a testament to Kim’s success in wresting power from military chieftains and eliminating rivals since his father died in 2011. It also illustrates his long-held desire to restore an economy drained by decades of famine, state planning and military expansion under his father and grandfather.“If you want to really understand the Kim Jong Un of the present, you have to travel back to his early years,” said Kim Young-hui, who defected from North Korea in 2002 and is now a senior economist at the Korea Development Bank’s Inter-Korean Economic Cooperation Research Unit.He wondered why his father, Kim Jong Il, hadn’t traveled overseas much “and why North Korea was so poor,” she said, citing a book by a Japanese chef who worked for the late dictator. “Kim Jong Un was thinking that when he became the leader, he would run the country a lot better than his reclusive father.”Over the past seven years, the Swiss-educated Kim has steered North Korea from his father’s “military first” policy focused on building a nuclear arsenal to one that emphasizes the economy. After successfully testing an intercontinental ballistic missile in 2017, he declared the weapons program “complete,” initiated talks with Trump and announced a new strategy for boosting the economy.The move ended Trump’s threats of war and paved the way for a historic first meeting with the US president in June. It also opened a new world of potential investors from Seoul to Singapore -- provided Kim can get Trump to relax international sanctions against his weapons program.Trump played down expectations that he might quickly ease pressure on North Korea, telling US governors gathered at the White House on Sunday: “I’m not pushing for speed, but we’re not removing the sanctions.”In recent months, Kim has railed against the sanctions, which do everything from ban travel by officials to curb its energy imports. North Korea ranks as one of the world’s poorest countries and the sanctions are believed to have helped cause the country’s deepest recession in two decades in 2017, according to South Korean estimates.“When they come to negotiations, it means they are having a tough time internally due to sanctions and Kim feels nervous,” said Thae Yong-ho, who was North Korea’s deputy ambassador to the UK before defecting in 2016 and becoming a critic of the regime.Kim left Pyongyang on Saturday afternoon on a train that will take him through China down to Vietnam. He traveled abroad five times last year -- more than any North Korean leader in at least two decades -- often visiting industrial sites. Kim reportedly plans to do the same in Vietnam ahead of the planned summit, giving him a close-up view of a fellow socialist state that has prospered after easing hostility with the US.North Korean officials have been spotted near Samsung Electronics Co.’s smartphone plants in Vietnam, the Yonhap News Agency reported last week, suggesting Kim may tour South Korean factories. While South Korea is Vietnam’s second-largest trading partner, a North Korean leader hasn’t visited Vietnam since Kim’s grandfather, Kim Il Sung, in 1964.Trump himself has repeatedly cited Kim’s development goals while arguing why North Korea would trade its nuclear arsenal away.“Chairman Kim realizes, perhaps better than anyone else, that without nuclear weapons, his country could fast become one of the great economic powers anywhere in the World,” Trump tweeted on Sunday. “Because of its location and people (and him), it has more potential for rapid growth than any other nation!”Kim hasn’t secured his control over North Korea by showing weakness. His reign has been marked by ruthless purges and executions, including the killing of his uncle and one-time deputy, Jang Song Thaek, as well as the murder of his older half-brother, Kim Jong Nam.That consolidation of power has given him the space to introduce economic and government reforms once seen as nearly impossible in the insular, one-party state. And it’s allowed him to shake hands with Trump, the leader of a country that North Korean propaganda has spent generations blaming for all of its problems.Even now, the purges appear to be continuing. Kim exiled, imprisoned or executed 50 to 70 members of the country’s political elite last year, including opponents of engagement with the US, according to a report published last week by the North Korea Strategy Center, a Seoul-based research institution founded by a former defector.“Kim Jong Un has been very skillful in rewarding the friendly, co-opting the neutral and punishing the hostile,” said Moon Chung-in, special adviser on foreign policy to South Korean President Moon Jae-in, said in an interview earlier this month. “His longevity is institutionally guaranteed. But at the same time he’s good at consolidating power.”Kim now needs to show the elite back in Pyongyang that his engagement efforts can bring economic opportunity without sacrificing the country’s nuclear deterrent -- its “treasured sword.” The regime has a long history of coming to the bargaining table dangling the prospect of cooperation, only to renege on deals after extracting economic concessions.Chun Yungwoo, former chief South Korean envoy to international nuclear negotiations with North Korea, said Kim’s successful consolidation of power requires him to consider what kind of country he wants to rule over for the next 40 to 50 years.“He wants to have a more prosperous country -- he wants economic development,” Chun said. “Without giving up nuclear weapons, all he can do is maintain a subsistence-level economy.”",0
476,"How railways put men at 11 level crossings a day Indian railways did away with at least 11 of its thousands of unmanned level crossings every day during the past 10 months to eliminate these death traps. The last such crossing on broad-gauge lines was converted into a gated one in Allahabad on Thursday, the same day railway minister Piyush Goyal confirmed in his budget speech that these unmanned crossings were a thing of the past. According to railway ministry officials, an accident on April 16, 2018 involving a school van at such a crossing on Kaptanganj-Thawe section in UP that claimed 13 lives was the turning point for putting the focus on quickly doing away with these crossings. “The ministry had told the Parliament these crossings would be a thing of past by March 2020. But work on a war footing was undertaken to complete the task earlier after the accident,” said an official. The number of accidents at unmanned level crossings has been at an all-time low at only three during this fiscal as compared to 65 in 2009-10. Sources said in most of the cases either mechanised or manual system of operating gates have been operationalised to stop vehicles from crossing the tracks when trains go past these spots. They added at some crossing, they have route relay interlocking system where the rail traffic flow is highe Officials said the railways had zeroed down on four models to eliminate the crossings including merger with another level crossing by constructing diversion road, construction of subway or rail under bridge and manning. The last option was found to be most cost effective and less time taking. Building rail under and over bridges often require land acquisition and other permissions.",1
477,"Huawei says Mate X’s India launch depends on 5G availability, no plans for 4G?variantPowered by the company’s Kirin 980 processor, the Huawei Mate X comes with a 6.6-inch dual display panel and offers a FullView display.Dashing hopes of Indian consumers willing to acquire the just-released foldable phone from Huawei any time soon, the company says it is not planning to bring a 4G version of the Mate X shortly and that its availability will depend on the 5G network in the country.Although India is targeting 2020 for 5G roll-out, the country is yet to allocate 5G spectrum to operators even for 5G trial of use cases.Expensive at 2,299 euros (about Rs 1,85,000), the foldable Mate X is a 5G phone and as the US has been raising security concerns over use of Huawei 5G equipment, the European market could be the first to see the release of the phone.Huawei showcased the foldable phone at Mobile World Congress (MWC), Barcelona, on Sunday, but did not allow the visiting journalists to touch the device.“We expect to start shipping the device form the middle of this year through the carrier channel. Making the device available in the open market may take some time,” Kevin Ho, President of the Handset Business, Huawei Consumer Business Group, told IANS here.Replying to a question about producing foldable phone for the 4G network, he said that although the company was not focusing on bringing a 4G to suit markets like India, it could consider such a proposal at a later stage.Powered by the company’s Kirin 980 processor, the Huawei Mate X comes with a 6.6-inch dual display panel and offers a FullView display.It houses massive 4,500 mAH dual battery and several industry-first features, including a new superfast charging capability that can reach 85 per cent battery in just 30 minutes.The phone features a flexible OLED panel and a falcon wing mechanical hinge.“Creating the foldable phone’s hinge is the most challenging part for our engineers,” Ho said. “We had to design the hinge to avoid layers like formation that one gets when one folds a book or a notebook. This was a big challenge and they had to use a sophisticated technology,” he added.While Ho asserted that the phone was ready for mass production, he acknowledged that the company was still doing several tests and was also in talks with app developers so that apps can be optimised for a foldable device.The 8GB + 512 GB phone, which can be easily unfolded at the click of a button, now has only one colour, Interstellar Blue, and comes with a full protection case. Huawei said it might introduce new colours for the device at a later stage.When unfolded, the 6.6-inch dual display panel transforms into an 8-inch tablet only 5.4mm thick.While unveiling the device on Sunday at a packed hall here, Huawei Consumer Business Group CEO Richard Yu claimed that the phone offers best selfie camera. But the company did not reveal the camera specifications.“The phone will provide users more privacy and security protection,” he said.“Today, many carriers are using NSA (non-standalone) architecture, working together with 4G. But the future of 5G is SA (standalone) architecture.“Mate X is the only phone now with the capability to work in both the architecture. So this phone is not only for today, but also for future 5G,” Yu noted.Ho parried questions on security concerns raised by countries like the US which accuse Huawei of passing on data to the Chinese government.“We don’t want to talk about it today. We want to focus on technology and our new products today,” he said.",0

No casualty was reported.The crash happened barely 15 minutes after it took off from Gorakhpur air base along with two other Jaguars for routine exercise.Panic-stricked locals rushed to the site of the burning wreckage in large numbers, Kushinagar district magistrate Anil Kumar said.An eyewitness said they saw the aircraft explode in flames in the sky before hitting the ground with a bang while the pilot landed in a sandy area close to the river bed.“Two other such planes continued to hover in sky when the aircraft crashed. The strong winds intensified the flames of the burning plane and soon it was reduced to ashes,” said another eyewitness.On being informed by locals, police and administration officials, including DM Kumar and senior superintendent of police (SSP) Rajeev Mishra, rushed to the accident site with rescue teams and fire tenders, while an air force chopper airlifted the injured pilot to Gorakhpur airbase where he was admitted for treatment of minor injuries on his back.While the cause of the crash is not known, a court of inquiry has been ordered by Gorakhpur air force officials.Speaking on phone, wing commander Prayagraj air force station, Arvind Sinha, said: “An inquiry has been ordered to look in to the reason of the mishap.”The district magistrate said “the pilot showed courage and presence of mind by diverting the plane away from populated area towards the Chhoti Gandak river but it crashed midway in a field after catching fire. He saved his life by jumping off the plane when it was just about 150 metres from the crash site. He is fine and undergoing treatment at Gorakhpur air force hospital”.",0

480,"Illegal shrines derail centre’s multi-modal terminal project in VaranasiThe National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government’s plan to set up a so-called multi-modal terminal which provides rail, road and waterways connectivity in Varanasi , Uttar Pradesh has run into trouble because of places of worship that have been illegally constructed on the land meant for the project.“Land has been an issue in this project. There are certain sensitivities; there are three mosques and four temples on the railway land on which we want to build the terminal,” a senior official at the ministry of road transport said requesting anonymity. This person added that the ministry doesn’t want to push things on this front because demolishing places of worship could become a contentious issue ahead of the next year’s parliamentary polls.The proposed terminal at Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s constituency is part of the Jal Marg Vikas Project (JMVP, a Rs 5,369 crore World Bank aided project on the Ganga, aimed at augmenting the navigational capacity of the Varanasi to Haldia stretch of the river, to enable commercial navigation of at least 1500-2000 ton vessels).The land in question belongs to the Railways which leased it out to National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) for construction of a bus and a railway terminal.“This is railways’ land and has been given to the NHAI on an ‘as is where is’ basis and they were to further develop that land. The issue is that on some of the land there are mosques and temples. They are unable to find a way to remove them. So i don’t think that project will be able to go forward,” a senior official at ministry of railway said on condition for anonymity.The government had awarded the contract to AFCONS Infrastructure for the construction of phase I of the Multi-Modal Terminal at Varanasi for Rs 170 crore.“ Railways land is usually very old, this one must be around 150 years old hence we don’t know when or how these structures were built they assume that they have been built in the last 20 years. The land is around 100 acres big. We had handed over the rights of the land to NHAI about two months ago,” the railways official said.The Detailed Project Report (DPR) of the construction of the project was prepared by NHAI. It involved building a multi-modal terminal including a railway station and a bus terminal. The land is situated at Kashi station in Varanasi. “There is no easy solution to such sensitive issues. The basic issue is that before construction has to happen it is important to remove these places of worship. NHAI has asked the civil administration to look into it but they also have their own compulsion since this happens to be a sensitive religious issue,” the railway ministry official added.The project has been caught up in land related issues since its inception. Another piece of land near the proposed water terminal couldn’t be acquired initially.“We had some issues which were finally sorted out. There was a group of ‘Hindu Mahants’ who had ownership of the land and they argued that they would not vacate this till the government gave them another plot in the same area, which also was disputed. Officials and state had to get involved to resolve it,” a senior official at the ministry of shipping said.Union minister for road transport, highways and shipping Nitin Gadkari laid the foundation stone for the terminal at Varanasi in August, 2016. The ministry is now considering changing its plans. “There are many land related issues in this project. There was also a small patch of land which was allotted and leased to some trust and now the trust claims to own the land. There are issues with some religious structures. So we are looking at whether it is feasible to overcome this or adjust the entire layout of the multi-modal hub, “ the road ministry official said.Under JMVP, three multi-modal terminals are being constructed at Varanasi, Sahibganj and Haldia. The total financial progress for the project at the end of 2017-18 was ~678.85 crore or 13.05%. JMVP is scheduled to be completed by December, 2022.According to officials at the ministry of shipping and the IWAI, the government is keen to get the water terminal inaugurated by PM in November. According to IWAI, nearly 85% of the work has been completed for the water terminal. The agency added that all issues related to land have been addressed. “The project construction is going on schedule without any hindrances,” IWAI said.",1

482,"In Gorakhpur rally, PM Modi set the tone for Lok Sabha poll battle in PurvanchalPrime Minister Narendra Modi has set the pitch for a fierce poll battle in Purvanchal region (east UP) with the announcement of the launch of Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN) as well as Rs 10,000-crore development projects for the region on Sunday.Aware of the importance of 31 Lok Sabha seats of east UP that will be crucial in regaining power at the Centre, Modi said the NDA government had launched several development and welfare schemes to give thrust to development in the region.“The projects will pave way for development of Purvanchal that remained neglected under the Congress, Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) and the Samajwadi Party (SP) governments,” he said.The prestige of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) will be at stake as its top leaders, including PM Narendra Modi, Kalraj Mishra, Manoj Sinha, Varun Gandhi, Mahendra Nath Pandey and UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath come from this region.In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the BJP had swept this region by grabbing all the seats except Azamgarh that went into the SP’s kitty. The Congress won two while the BSP failed to open its account.As the BJP plans to bag maximum seats from the region, various development and welfare schemes have been announced during public meetings in PM’s Lok Sabha constituency Varanasi, located on the southern tip of Purvanchal, and Gorakhpur that is located in the north.With the SP-BSP combine and the Congress also shifting their focus on Purvanchal, the BJP is going all out to win maximum support from the region.The SP-BSP alliance has shared equal number of seats in Purvanchal to give a tough fight to BJP.Once a strong fort of alliance partners, the BJP made inroads into their vote base in the 2014 Lok Sabha election.SP leader Shivram Yadav said, “Riding on Dalit-Backwards-Muslim formula, the alliance hopes to check the BJP.”The Congress has appointed Priyanka Gandhi Vadra as its general secretary for east UP. The region had played a major role in the formation of UPA government in 2004 and 2009 Lok Sabha elections.In 2014, Congress was wiped out in Purvanchal which was its stronghold since Independence.Congress has also appointed three secretaries – Zubair Khan, Kumar Ashish and Bajirao Khade – to assist Priyanka in the battle of ballot. The party plans to win over upper castes, Dalits and Muslims that were its traditional vote base.That the BJP is concerned over the SP-BSP alliance as well as Congress’s Purvanchal plan can be gauged from the fact that during their address both the PM as well as the CM highlighted the government’s development schemes and attacked the opposition parties.Modi said the BJP government strengthened health facilities in the region, restarted fertiliser factory, electrified rail routes, started manufacturing of railway engine in Varanasi and Gorakhpur to pave way for prosperity in the area.Political analyst AK Mishra said, “To retain the BJP’s hold on Purvanchal region, Modi launched PM-KISAN Scheme in Gorakhpur. Purvanchal region is the agriculture hub of the state and the support of farmers will play a decisive role in elections. The SP-BSP alliance is working on caste equations to win the election while Congress is depending on the magic of Priyanka Gandhi. Besides YogiModi charisma, BJP is playing Purvanchal development card to win the election.”",0
483,"In the next 3-4 years, all trains will run fast and on time’Manish Anand , said that his ministry would soon move the Union Cabinet for approval of “government-to-government” partnerships with foreign countries, a step beyond the concept of foreign direct investment.We saw big-ticket FDI investment in the railway workshop projects at Madhepura and Mahraura in Bihar to the tune of Rs 40,000 crore. What would be the next big FDI investment in the railways We have seen massive interest from a number of countries in the modernisation of our railway stations. South Korea has already submitted its model of redevelopment of the New Delhi railway station. South Korea is ready with a proposal to invest as much as Rs 8,000 crore in the modernisation of the New Delhi railway station. The model is with us, which will be a complete gamechanger as far as a railway station is seen. France is keen to redevelop the Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus in Mumbai. The French are also working for the re-development of Ludhiana station. In the coming times, we will see major FDI inflow into the railway sector.You have been to Germany, France, Japan and many other countries. The railways appear to have become India’s engagement with foreign countries. What can we expect from these countries in the railways We are soon going to the Union Cabinet for approval to enter into “government-to-government” (G-G) investment (agreements). We are ready to sign agreements with as many as 14 countries. They are ready to partner with Indian Railways to make their governments partners in the progress of the railways. Among the 14 countries are Japan, China, Germany, Czechoslovakia, South Korea, France and the United Arab Emirates. G-G investment is better than FDI for the railways because here we do not have to worry about the involvement of private players. The money will come from the government of the partner country. In the coming years, we are going to witness massive G-G investment in the railways. Japan alone is going to invest close to $25 billion in Indian Railways, besides the bullet train project.After commissioning the semi-high-speed rail between New Delhi and Agra, what progress can we expect on speeding up the railways We are going to offer one semi-high-speed route each to the 14 countries with which we are soon going to operationalise the G-G investment model. These countries will build the infrastructure and Indian Railways will integrate them into the existing system. Thus, we can have a large number of semi-high-speed rail networks getting commissioned at the same time; this can change the very face of the railways and the country in the next four to five years.We already are holding trials of the Spanish semi-high-speed Talgo trains. It’s a matter of a few weeks in which we will know the full details of the claims being made by Talgo. Once we get the details, we will take the next course of action.The Bibek Debroy Committee on the restructuring of the Railway Board was constituted soon after the Narendra Modi government came to power. Many more committees have in the past submitted reports. What is being done about their reports So far we have already implemented almost 90 per cent of the recommendations of the Bibek Debroy Committee. We have constituted two cross-functional directorates for non-tariff revenue and mobility, which will directly report to the chairman, Railway Board. We have already delegated powers to the general managers and divisional railway managers. Soon we will sign a memorandum of understanding with the zonal railways in which we will ensure their functional autonomy. Thus, much of the desired outcomes of the various committees have been implemented so far, and much more will be done. Very soon we are also going to establish the rail tariff authority. We are currently examining the legislative and non-legislative components of the proposed authority.In the beginning of the coming to power of the Modi government, we heard much talk about the lateral entry of professionals in government departments. Is the idea still alive We are soon going to induct 100 interns from outside the railways who would become part of the organisation. We are keen to take outside professionals, and the cross-functional directorates would look to benefit from their talent pool.With a soft loan from Japan in place for the bullet train project between Ahmedabad and Mumbai, the popular perception persists that such investment should have come in for existing railway infrastructure. There is a place for a five-star hotel in an economy and similarly a bullet train project too is important for the country. In our economy we have five-star hotels where we do not expect the common man to go. We are not going to invest anything in the bullet train project. The money is coming from Japan. But we will gain from the induction of technology, the safety standards, the capacity to execute big-ticket projects, besides the huge spin-off effect on the economy by spending such a huge sum of money in the country.When are we going to see the fruits of the investment being made in capacity augmentation by the railways, which has been the priority of your two projects In the last financial year we commissioned 2,828 km of new lines, broad gauge conversion and doubling. In the next two years we will add almost 7,000 km of such lines. We are going to invest close to Rs 45,000 crore in the next two years for such projects. By 2019, we hope to commission the twin dedicated freight corridors between Dadri and JNPT, Mumbai and Ludhiana-Kolkata. With their commissioning, much of the tracks will be available for running of trains and will also allow us to time-table the goods trains. In the next three to four years trains will not only run on time, but fast and tickets would also be available on demand",1

487,"Indian Railways And Facilities Provided To The PublicIn the entire world, Indian railways has gained the position of being the largest public system of passengers transport. About 7500 trains for passengers are run by Indian railways carrying 12 million people on an average every day. The first train was run in 1853 from Mumbai’s Victoria Terminals to Thane. A British engineer Robert Maitland Brereton was responsible for the expansion of railways from the year 1857 onwards. Indian Railways is world’s seventh largest utility employer with over 1,376 million employees. As for rolling stock Indian Railways holds over 2,45,267 freights wagons, 66,392 passenger coaches and 10,499 locomotives and runs 12,617 passenger trains and 7421 freight trains daily. Indian Railways earn about 70 per cent of its revenues from freight traffic so majority of its profits come from freight and this makes up for losses on passengers fares low it cross-subsidises the loss making passenger traffic with the profit making freight traffic. However its share in freight traffic is much lower than road traffic. This should be looked into and rational approach for fixing fares for goods trains and passenger trains. Railways has two UNESCO world heritage sites namely the Chatrapari Shivaji Terminus and the mountain railways of India. But, this huge organisation is running in losses of Rs. 30, 000 crores in the passenger segment for the year ending March 2014. As in the practise of railway ministry, new railway line projects are announced during the railway budget each year, without securing additional funding for them. In the last 12 years 99 new line projects worth Rs. 60,000 crores were announced out of which only one project is complete till date while four projects that are as old as 30 years, but are still not complete. This practise of announcing new railway line projects needs a serious approach and should not be announced without proper sanction of budget is there. The passenger facilities like waiting rooms and retiring rooms, needs a serious and practical approach. The passenger associations and railway employees must be consulted on regular basis. Often there are no proper electricity connections for charging mobile phones and they are over crowded. Most of the major railway stations have these waiting rooms, but one cannot be sure of their presence in all stations across India. Retiring rooms are there in larger and important railway stations. Retiring rooms can be basic rooms or dormitory or suits. But these retiring or waiting rooms lack recommended amenities. The railway ministry must pay attention to them rather than to announce new railway line, which may not come without provision of funding.",1

A release from ISMA said: ""As on 15th February, 2019, 507 sugarNSE 14.71 % mills in the country have produced 219.30 lakh tonnes of sugar, as compared to 203.55 lakh tonnes produced by 494 mills on the corresponding date last year. Higher production this year is mainly because Maharashtra and Karnataka sugar mills started their crushing earlier this year. Overall, the country is expected to produce less sugar this season as compared to last season."" According to ISMA, in Maharashtra, sugar production till 15th February 2019 was 82.98 lakh tonnes, compared with 74.74 lakh tonnes produced last year same period. In the current 2018-19 SS, 6 mills have closed their crushing operations in the State while 187 sugar mills are operating, as against 183 mills operated last year on the corresponding date. Due to early start of mills in Maharashtra, the mills therein are expected to close earlier than last year, especially when the sugar production from Maharashtra will be less than last year. In U.P. 117 sugar mills are in operation and they have produced 63.93 lakh tonnes of sugar till 15th February 2019, compared with 64.54 lakh tonnes produced by 119 mills on the corresponding date of last year. The sugar recovery achieved this season is about 0.77% more than what was achieved so far during the last season, but the yield per hectare is lower than last year, because of which the total production in U.P. will be less than last year.In case of Karnataka, till 15th February, 2019, mills have produced 38.74 lakh tonnes of sugar, 10 mills have closed their operations in the State while 57 mills are in operation. During the corresponding period last year, 52 mills had produced 30.73 lakh tonnes sugar. In case of Tamil Nadu, 33 sugar mills are in operation and have produced 3.50 lakh tonnes of sugar, as compared to 2.90 lakh tonnes produced by 28 sugar mills in 2017-18 SS on the corresponding date. Gujarat has produced 7.78 lakh tonnes of sugar till 15th February 2019 with 16 sugar mills in operation. Last year, 17 sugar mills were in operation and they had produced 7.25 lakh tonnes of sugar on the same date. In Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, 24 sugar mills have produced 4.50 lakh tonnes as on 15th February 2019, as compared to 4.60 lakh tonnes produced by 23 sugar mills on the corresponding date last season. In Bihar, Uttarakhand, Punjab, Haryana and Madhya Pradesh & Chhattisgarh, sugar production till 15th February 2019 has been in the order of 4.90 lakh tonnes,2.15 lakh tonnes, 3.75 lakh tonnes, 3.60 lakh tonnes and 3.20 lakh tonnes, respectively.

At least 200 have been injured.Sources said the probe team was also looking into allegations that the two loco pilots — Janak Sharma and Pramesh Purohit — were drunk at the time of the accident. Sharma, Purohit and train guard Ajay Srivastava appeared before the inquiry panel headed by rail safety (eastern railways) commissioner PK Acharya on Tuesday to record their statements. “Blood samples of the pilots were taken and sent for medical examination. The report hasn’t come yet,” said Acharya.The panel summoned 41 railway employees of different departments in Jhansi railway division for their written statement. Some people, mostly passengers, also came to record their statements.The panel will record statements of people and railway personnel for two days but the period can be extended. The inquiry report will be submitted within a month to the Railways ministry.Railway men mostly stuck to the version that there was no problem with the train. Gate man Ravindra Paswan, who was at gate no 197 at the time of the mishap, said in his deposition before the panel that the train was moving at normal speed and there was no issue with it.However, Ishwar Dass, another railway employee, said when the train passed his point at 3.01am, it left the overhead wires dangling, indicating that it was running at high speed.

491,"International Conference On Decarbonization Of Indian Railways- Mission Electrification Begins TodayMinistry of Railways through Institution of Railways Electrical Engineer (IREE) in partnership with ASSOCHAM India is organising the International Conference on Decarbonization of Indian Railways- Mission Electrification today. Member Traction, Railway Board Ashwani Kumar Kapoor briefed about this conference and gave following information:-An International Conference on “Decarbonization of Indian Railways – Mission Electrification” is being organized in New Delhi on 3rd Nov.’16.The Conference aims at bringing various stakeholders on a common platform for exchange of ideas and to deliberate on implementable technological solutions and financing options to significantly increase pace of electrification and achieve the target for setting up of renewable energy installations with total capacity of 1000MW by 2020.The Conference will also project Indian Railways as an attractive investment destination considering its plans for huge investment in next 5 years towards modernization of its electrified network and use of renewable energy.The Conference shall cover aspects relating to policy, technological modernization, mechanization, innovations and financing models for railway electrification and de-carbonization. National Transport Development Policy Committee (NTDPC), in its report, has identified electrification of railway tracks as a means to reduce fuel consumption. The report has recommended for taking up electrification on priority through systematically tackling the bottlenecks in progress of electrification projects. It has also suggested that electrification should be viewed as a means of making rail transport independent of imported fossil energy, while also provide a choice in sourcing energy. Moreover, electric traction allows regeneration of power while braking/coasting and feeding the network, thereby reducing overall consumption of energy and carbon emissions. In this regard, following action has been planned for improving efficiency and bringing in cost economies in freight and passenger operations. Reducing the Carbon Foot prints through use of sustainable and green sources of energy is also a key focus area.In line with this vision, following action plan has been planned: Electrification of Railway TracksCurrently 28,000 rkm of tracks are electrified (42% of the total network) carrying around two-thirds of total freight traffic and 50% of total passenger traffic. As against 800 kms of average electrification in the earlier years, 1600 rkm of railway tracks were electrified in 2015-16. To fast track the pace of electrification, Ministry of Railway would be involving PSUs like IRCON, RITES and PGCIL. Increase in the pace of electrification will reduce its fuel bill by Rs. 10,000 cr. annually as against the business as usual approach. Harnessing Renewable Energy on IR to reduce energy cost and carbon footprints Indian Railways targets to harness 1 GW solar and 500 MW wind power as announced in Rail Budget 2015-’16, 500 MW of solar units on roof tops through Central Finance Assistance (CFA) from MNRE and balance 500 MW on land.",1

493,"Is it curtains for Congress' Bansal?One could hear a pin drop at former railway minister and Congress candidate Pawan Bansal's residence at Sector 28 on Friday afternoon, as it became clear that the Chandigarh MP for the last three times in a row will lose the seat. As it later transpired, he lost by 69,642 votes, the highest-ever for the city, polling 1,21, 720 votes.The day started as usual for him as he rose even before sunrise, at around 5:30am. A quick shower and prayer followed by a cup of tea was what it took for him to be ready to accept the people's verdict, and as the day wore on, he looked increasingly downcast. The handful of supporters that had gathered before counting began also dwindled away as the trends that showed him trailing trickled in.So, as Bansal with wife Madhu visited the counting centre at around 9:30am and was back in half an hour, the writing was on the wall and the deserted Congress office in Sector 35 said it all.It is clear that the Railgate, the infighting within the party, the anti-incumbency against the UPA, the nation-wide Modi wave and the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) factors combined led to the defeat of the four-time parliamentarian.With the Congress suffering a humiliating defeat across the country and Bansal losing, in what was his bastion, is it curtains on the political career of the veteran political leader?Bansal, who had held important positions in the UPA-1 and UPA-11 including the parliamentary affairs ministry and the railway ministry, will be without any work now as HT brings you the reasons for the loss.Less than expected votes from coloniesAs more than half of the 6.13 lakh voters were from colonies and villages and the turnout here had always been high, Bansal had expected a sizeable number of votes. He probably failed to hold ground here against the Modi wave. The BJP's focus on highlighting the Railgate, where his nephew was caught by the CBI accepting `90 lakh for a posting, when he was the railway minister, probably influenced the voters. AAP candidate Gul Panag also took away some of these votes.",1

497,"Kangana Ranaut attacks Manikarnika co-director Krish after NTR biopic’s failure, says time to question ‘every vulture’Kangana Ranaut has criticised Manikarnika co-director Krrish as his NTR biopic failed to perform at the box office, saying ‘now is the time to question every vulture who was out for my blood’.Actor Kangana Ranaut has constantly been in headlines for her film Manikarnika: The Queen of Jhansi which eventually entered the Rs 100 crore club at the domestic box office. Earlier, co-director Krish had accused the actor of hijacking the film and a bitter exchange of words had followed the film’s release. Krish had reportedly left Manikarnika to direct the NTR biopic titled NTR Mahanayakudu, which failed at the box office.This has now given the actor one more reason to criticise the filmmaker. On being asked about the same, Kangana told Pinkvilla, “Yes, I also read about zero recovery of NTR, it’s called black mark on the actor’s career. My heart goes out to Balakrishna sir who trusted Krish and put so much at stake, but for me now is the time to question every vulture who was out for my blood, who attacked and harassed me for taking charge of a troubled situation and making a critically acclaimed and commercially successful film (Manikarnika), but what is shameful is that Krish and some paid media ran a sabotage campaign against a martyr’s biopic. Honestly, I am embarrassed of them, our freedom fighters gave blood for some thankless fools.”The actor was part of several controversies and had accused Bollywood celebrities of not supporting her during the film’s release. It seems she has finally found support in senior actors including Anupam Kher and Paresh Rawal who have slammed people on social media for making fun of a behind-the-scene video featuring Kangana on a mechanical horse during the shooting of battle scenes for Manikarnika.While her sister Rangoli had spoken up in her defence and justified how an actor’s close-up is shot just like all Bollywood and Hollywood films, now Paresh Rawal and Anupam Kher have come out in her support.Paresh Rawal took to Twitter to justify Rangoli’s stand and sharing how scenes are shot with the help of special effects. He tweeted, “According to these dimwits and pinheads they believe that superman and Batman in Hollywood films are actually flying and it’s not some camera trick or CG effects ...!”Anupam had earlier called out a user for criticising Kangana for not using a real horse to shoot some battle scenes. He had tweeted, “How much venom this man has against a self made actress #KanganaRanaut!! This is called ‘acting’ idiot. Actors all over the world do that. That is their job. She will be remembered for decades for her hard work in movies. While you got your fifteen minute fame by using her name.”Earlier, co-director Krish had accused the actor of hijacking the film and a bitter exchange of words had followed the film’s release. Kangana had earlier called out Alia Bhatt and Aamir Khan for not supporting her films, claiming she always does the same for others. Kangana said while she attended the screenings of Dangal, Secret Superstar and Raazi, Alia and Aamir did not return the favour.According to a report in Pinkvilla, Kangana said she made a phonecall to Alia and told her to ‘grow a spine’. She said, “I suggested that she (Alia) grows some spine and support an important film about woman empowerment and nationalism....if she doesn’t have a voice of her own and her existence is all about being KJo (Karan Johar) puppet then I don’t consider her successful... I told her if she is only focusing on earning bucks and not raise a voice, then her success has no value.... hope she understands the true meaning of success and her responsibilities, Napo gang life is simply restricted to give and take favours hope she rises above that.”",0

The excluded professionals include doctors, engineers, lawyers, chartered accountants and architects registered with professional bodies, the agriculture ministry said in the operational guidelines for the Pradhan Mantri KIsan SAmman Nidhi (PM-KISAN) scheme announced in the interim budget on February 1. The government will not cover those with a monthly pension of Rs 10,000 or more. The scheme promises to pay Rs 6,000 a year in three instalments to farmers who own up to 2 hectares of land, with the first instalment due for the period from December 1 to March 31. States have been given a deadline of February 25 to submit lists of eligible farmers. The cut-off date for eligible farmers is February 1 of this year, after which new owners of agricultural land won’t be considered for the next five years. “However, benefit will be allowed in those cases where transfer of ownership of cultivable land takes place on account of succession due to death of the landowner,” according to a document on the website of the Department of Agriculture Cooperation & Farmers Welfare. An alternative mechanism will be set up for the northeast, where land ownership is often community based, making it difficult to select eligible famers. The mechanism for eligibility of northeast farmers will be developed and approved by a committee of Union ministers from the Ministry of Development of North East Region (DoNER), Ministry of Land Resources, Agriculture Minister and the state chief ministers or their ministerial representative, based on the proposal by the northeast states concerned. The Centre has asked the states to identify and designate a sponsoring bank for this scheme. “States may consider designating the same bank being used for transfer of fund for MNRGES as sponsoring bank for this scheme,” it said. It said the designated bank should have well-developed IT systems with the capabilities of integration with the web portal of the scheme and Public FinancialManagement System (PFMS).",0

Sharma counts himself as one of them.“The Trans bill is the single biggest mistake of the [ruling] BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party],” he said. “If it is passed, it will make life very difficult for us.” The bill, however, was not taken up by the Rajya Sabha during the final session of Parliament.Sharma, who identifies as a transman, cannot get a voter ID card made, because, in a conundrum that is peculiar to the transgender community, he does not have “proof” of his gender identity. The two identifying documents that he possesses, the Aadhaar card and PAN (Permanent Account Number) card, are in the female gender he was assigned at birth. “I am not making a voter ID card right now because I know that it will be difficult to change the gender and name on it. First I’ll get my Aadhaar and PAN card corrected, and then I’ll get all these made.” Does he know what needs to be done? “Yes, main aapko batata hoon (let me tell you about it),” he said, narrating the procedure. When will he do it? Soon, he replies.",0
504,"Lok Sabha elections 2019: BJP to go it alone in HaryanaThe Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) would go it alone in Haryana in the forthcoming Lok Sabha elections, party’s co-incharge for parliamentary polls in the state, Vishwas Sarang, said.Sarang, who was in Kurukshetra on Saturday to attend a workshop of party workers from Kurukshetra, Karnal, Ambala and Sonepat Lok Sabha constituencies, said the decision about party candidates would be taken by the party’s central leadership after discussion with state leaders.Exuding confidence that the BJP would win all the 10 Lok Sabha seats in Haryana, Sarang said the results of Jind assembly byelection had proved that opposition parties, especially the Congress, had lost ground in the state.He, however, parried question on why the BJP had not taken action against Kurukshetra MP Raj Kumar Saini, who has formed a separate party.Earlier, addressing party workers in the Kurukshetra University’s auditorium, chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar said Prime Minister Narendra Modi will address 11 crore party workers in the country on February 28. BJP’S national president Amit Shah would hold a meeting of party workers at Hisar on February 25 and on March 2, a bike rally would be taken out in every assembly constituency of the state, he said.Without taking any name, Khattar alleged that many Congress leaders were facing corruption cases. “Leaders alone cannot be blamed for corruption. Government officers and employees also play an equal role,” he added.“But we have managed to eliminate corruption, ”the CM said.Khattar and BJP’S Haryana in-charge Anil Jain also launched a mobile app of ‘Digital BJP Haryana’ on the occasion.",0
505,"Maha-­Metro faces land acquisition hurdles in old Pune or ‘peth’ areasMaharashtra Metro Rail Corporation Ltd (Maha-Metro) is facing opposition from residents in the old Pune or ‘peth’ areas for acquiring land for construction of Metro stations at Budhwar peth and Mandai.Maha-Metro had already identified 322 entities whose properties will need to be acquired in these areas for carrying out the construction work. Brijesh Dixit, managing director, Maha-Metro said, “It is natural to face opposition for land acquisition. No one is willing to give their property. However, the government needs to acquire the lands to complete the projects in the larger interest.”Dixit said there are 205 Metros working in the world and all of them face similar problems when it comes to land acquisition. However, Maha-Metro is planning to give “good compensation” to the project affected people and is keeping all options open such as giving cash component or alternate property at another location, and TDR (transfer of development rights) for handing over the properties.“This is a crowed area and Maha-Metro will need these properties for erecting the metro stations. The metro corridors will not need land acquisition,” he said.The affected properties have been surveyed by Maha-Metro with the help of third party as well its project officials. The authorities have also assured to rehabilitate the affected people in the same locality. PMC has one plot in the city area which can be developed and all the affected families can be rehabilitated in the same locality, he said.Dixit said Maha Metro will ensure that no injustice would be done to anyone during the land acquisition process.Railway ministry gives approvalAfter defence ministry, the railway ministry has given its approval for crossings over railway lines on the Pune Metro route and connectivity with Khadki, Shivajinagar and Pune stations.Brijesh Dixit, managing director, maharashtra metro rail corporation said, “Pune is lucky as it is getting speedy permissions for the Metro project. After the defence ministry’s recent nod to hand over 10 acres land at Khadki, Dapodi and Range Hills, the railway ministry has given its approval for crossing the railway lines near Kamgar Putala and connecting of metro stations with railway stations at Khadki, Shivajinagar and Pune Railway station.The defence ministry has cleared the Pune Metro right of way permission as also the land transfer proposal for Metro stations,” he said.The Maha Metro’s Pimpri-Chinchwad to Swargate Metro corridor is passing from the Khadki Cantonment area for which defence land is required for parking and construction of railway stations at Khadki, Dapodi and at Range Hills. Land is also required from the defence ministry for erecting the metro corridor of 1.3 km from Khadki to Range Hills. Maha Metro had submitted its proposal to the defence ministry six months ago and was continuously following it up. With the clearances having arrived, the work on the metro corridor will now be speeded up, he said.",1

507,"Major intersections in Delhi death traps for pedestriansMajor intersections in Delhi are turning into death traps for pedestrians. With the rising number of vehicles and a lack of infrastructure for at-grade (at the surface level) crossings, the number of deaths involving pedestrians continues its steep rise every year.According to Delhi Police estimates, of the 1,604 people killed in road accidents last year, around 40% were pedestrians.(Picture for representation)Major intersections in Delhi are turning into death traps for pedestrians. With the rising number of vehicles and a lack of infrastructure for at-grade (at the surface level) crossings, the number of deaths involving pedestrians continues its steep rise every year. According to Delhi Police estimates, of the 1,604 people killed in road accidents last year, around 40% were pedestrians.The task of crossing at intersectionsCrossing busy intersections is an uphill task most pedestrians face on a regular basis. The art of racing to the other side of the road in a fraction of a second before the signal turns red for one section, and green for the other, is something that Delhiites have mastered over the years.An estimate by the Indian Road Congress (IRC) shows an average pedestrian in Delhi takes around seven to eight minutes to cross a busy intersection from end-to-end.This is because the signal timings often ignore those who mean to reach their final destination. After crossing each carriageway, pedestrians have to make a pit-stop for at least two minutes on dividers before they get to cross again. With proper infrastructure, this time can be reduced to three minutes, road safety experts said.They maintained that at intersections, signal timings should be adjusted with the average time taken by a pedestrian to cross the intersection from one end to the other kept in mind. Any breaks will only result in people jumping in front of vehicles off-turn and ending up risking their lives.Sahil Kumar, a bank employee working in Rohini’s Sector 18, said that during the peak morning traffic, he often has to wave at vehicles to slow down so that he can cross the road.“Most drivers end up hurling abuse at you for suddenly jumping on the road, waving your hand like a traffic police officer. But what option do we have? Waiting for these vehicles to stop will mean waiting for at least 15-20 minutes,” Kumar said. He added that the installation of pedestrian signals will give people like him some breather.“We constantly have drives to educate and fine drivers who stop their vehicles beyond the stop line, eating up on the zebra crossing for pedestrians. Safe roads are everyone’s right,” said joint commissioner of police (traffic) Alok Kumar. He also said that regular meetings are conducted with the road-owning agencies to come up with newer ways to make safe walking spaces for pedestrians.A study conducted by the IRC in 2016 proved that the presence of pedestrian signals on busy roads made people feel safer and decreased fatalities. It also showed pedestrians were willing to wait longer at such signals because of an assurance of safe passage when the lights go green.Lack of pedestrian infrastructureIn a 2013 study by Geetam Tiwari from Indian Institute of Technology (Delhi), the pattern of road accidents across major cities in the country over a span of five years was analysed, and it was confirmed that in the national capital, pedestrian deaths comprised at least 47% of all fatalities — the second highest in India after Mumbai.The reason for this alarming trend can be seen in the way the city’s roads are being designed. Despite studies proving pedestrian tendencies to cross the road at-grade, road-owning agencies are doing little to facilitate safe road crossing and walking facilities for them. The priority is on vehicles, which are the centre of the way the city’s roads are planned, experts said.Tiwari said India has been upgrading its highways with dividers, four- and six-lane roads and expressways since 2000. Yet, deaths due to road accidents continue to rise by 9%-10% each year.“The design completely ignores the requirements of walkers, bicyclists, two-wheeler users, even animal carts and other slow-moving traffic. We need to relook our car-centric road designs,” she said.As cities expand, so does vehicular traffic, but all emphasis is on ensuring better movement for cars, and so “cities are becoming hostile to pedestrians,” she said.Sample this. At the crossing outside the gates of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) on Sri Aurobindo Marg, despite the high pedestrian footfall of patients and their caretakers, there aren’t many avenues for people to cross over to the other side of the road safely, without having to wait endlessly.At the pedestrian signal at the gate, the lack of police presence sucks out any deterrence for speeding vehicles to give way to those looking to cross the road, and the apathy of road-owning agencies can be seen in the barely visible zebra crossing. Experts said that for government agencies, on most roads the only road-crossing facility is a gap between the grilles, through which a person or two can squeeze in.The solutionsTiwari said public spaces will improve if road designs move beyond the car-centric approach. “We need to change the way we design our roads and ensure better enforcement of rules,” she said. Experts stress the need to streamline the road geometry, bring the stop-line closer and make the intersection compact. “This will reduce the distance pedestrians have to walk and give them a sense of direction. We often find wide intersections that pedestrians are unable to cross in one go,” Amit Bhatt, director integrated transport, WRI India, maintained.Table-top crossings at slip roads can bring down the speed of vehicles and provide a smooth crossing facility to pedestrians. “Pedestrians prefer to cross at-grade. A majority of intersections are not well-designed. It is important that we factor in their requirements while redesigning our intersections. There is a need to provide refuge islands wherever possible,” Bhatt said.Also, government awareness programmes on road safety over the last 40 years have made little dent in improving road safety. The world over, research shows that individual behaviour cannot be changed without changing the physical environment in which traffic operates, and ensuring better enforcement of rules.The disadvantaged section of senior citizens and differently abled must be catered to. In most developed countries, provisions of pelican signals are made for the benefit of senior citizens, school children and differently abled, who can turn the pedestrian lights green to cross roads safely",0

They robbed him of his phone, smartwatch and wallet and forced him to withdraw money from ATM. (Shutterstock)Trying to help out an accident victim came at a high price for 24-year-old Rishabh Mandal who was duped, robbed of his valuables, and held captive for over two hours on Friday night.According to Mandal, he was on his way home in Patel Nagar, Delhi, when the incident occurred, near the Noida City Centre Metro station.“I got off an auto-rickshaw around 8pm at the service lane near the Metro station, when a man in his mid twenties approached me. He said his younger sister had met with an accident and was trapped in a car, and said he needed my help to pull her out of the car. I accompanied him to a street nearby to help him out,” Mandal, who is preparing for competitive exams, said.He said they were followed by another person, which was when he realised something was amiss.“The person who was following us asked what was going on. That’s when the tone of the man who asked for my help changed. I realised something was amiss and tried to leave. However, a third person blocked me from behind. One of them pulled out a gun and another held a knife to my throat. They took my phone, smartwatch and wallet. I didn’t have much cash on me so they asked me to withdraw money from any ATM. When I told them that I didn’t have money in the account, they asked me to arrange it and threatened me with dire consequences if I did not comply,” Mandal said.He said a couple of passersby were around. “But I was so scared that I could not approach them and anyone passing by would not have guessed what was going on. I called my elder brother for help. When he didn’t take the call, I called my younger brother and asked him to transfer money to my account,” he said, adding that the accused also suggested several excuses he could give his brother to encourage him to transfer the money.“I withdrew Rs 5,000, which he transferred to me and handed it over. They didn’t come into the ATM kiosk with me for fear of getting captured in the CCTV camera. When they realised that I was scared and was complying with their demands, they got greedier. They took my phone and asked my brother to send more money. They took nearly Rs 28,000 in multiple transactions,” he said.Mandal alleged that he tried to flee but the accused held him captive. “They were manhandling me the whole time and abusing me. They even threatened to kill me. Finally, around 10.10pm, when one of them was on his phone and the other two were talking, I decided to flee. They followed me, but I came upon a wedding party where I asked a few people for help. They gave me Rs 100 and dropped me at the Golf Course Metro station from where I came back home and filed an e-FIR,” said Mandal.Based on his complaint, a case of robbery (Section 392) under the Indian Penal Code was registered at the Sector 24 police station.“An investigation is ongoing in the case, and we will nab the accused soon,” Mithlesh Updhyay, station house officer, Sector 24 police station, said.",0

Gauri Mahadik (32), all set to join the Officers' Training Academy (OTA) at Chennai, said instead of just mourning her husband's death, she wanted to pay a befitting tribute to him by wearing his stars and uniform. Major Mahadik, who had joined the Army in 2012 and commissioned in the 7th Battalion of Bihar Regiment, died in the fire at his camp in Tawang near the Indo-China border in in December 2017. Post-completion of 49-week training at the OTA, Gauri Mahadik, a qualified company secretary and law graduate who recently topped the Service Selection Board (SSB) exam in the widow category, will be inducted into the Army as a Lieutenant by March 2020. ""After my husband's death, I was thinking what to do next...I thought I can not just sit and cry. So I decided that I should do something for him and make him proud. ""I decided to follow his footsteps and with a determination that I will wear his stars and uniform, started preparing for SSB examination,"" said Mahadik while talking to PTI from Virar, a distant suburb of Mumbai, over the phone.

517,"Ministry of Railways plans upgradation of 90 stations ahead of next general electionsModernised railway stations is something Indians have been long promised but it remains a pipe dream. Hopes were raised, yet again, in February when Finance Minister Arun Jaitley announced that 600 railway stations across the country had been picked for modernisation. All a part of the whopping Rs 1.48 trillion allocation to the railways - the highest ever for the sector - in the Modi government's last Budget before the next general elections.But then one remembered that a year earlier, then Railway Minister Suresh Prabhu had launched the first phase of what the ministry called the ""World's largest Station Redevelopment Program"", comprising 23 major railway stations. The idea was to redevelop the stations through the public-private-partnership (PPP) model, where the railways will provide approximately 140 acres of encroachment free land to the developers on a 45 year lease and hence the project would generally be cost neutral to the Railways. Moreover, according to a statement from the ministry at the time, the Rs 1 lakh crore program would benefit more than 100 cities and 16 million passengers per day across the country.Things did not quite pan out that way due to muted private investor interest. Undeterred, the Railways recently came out with a list of 68 stations earmarked for a facelift through its own resources before the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. The cost is pegged at Rs 5,000 crore. ""We can't wait for private investors anymore. We'll redevelop these stations on our own and could monetise them later through commercial exploitation,"" a top rail ministry official earlier told The Economic Times.The new list includes some of the busiest stations in the country like the Old Delhi railway station, Guwahati, Howrah, Patna, Allahabad, Udaipur, Haridwar, Pune, Bengaluru, Ambala, Chennai Egmore and Bhubaneshwar.The redevelopment plan has reportedly been assigned to the zonal railways with a one year deadline for completion. According to the daily, all the shortlisted railway stations will get state-of-the-art amenities, including elevators, swanky waiting room, a modern passenger announcement system, new platforms, shopping complex and airport-like entry and exit. The redevelopment will be closely monitored by the general managers of the respective zones and the divisional railway managers.""While doing this (redevelopment), efforts would be made to showcase local culture or history to reflect in the station facade. For instance Aurangabad station is to be developed on lines of Ajantha or Ellora, Agra station is to be developed on lines of Taj Mahal, Ujjain station is to be developed on lines of Mahakaleshwar temples,"" the ministry said in a statement in March.Apart from the 68 stations announced by the Railways, the redevelopment of the Habibganj railway station in Madhya Pradesh and the Gandhinagar railway station in Gujarat are already racing towards completion and seem on course to meet the December 2018 and January 2019 deadlines, respectively.These two stations have hogged the headlines of late given the impressive list of features they will pack. In case you missed the buzz, the Habibganj station will have a large waiting area comprising over 600 benches with neat and clean toilets and commercial hubs. Of the total Rs 450 crore allocated for the redevelopment of the Habibganj railway station, Rs 100 will be spent on improving the infrastructure, while the rest of the amount will be spent on building glass structures and facilities for food, entertainment, and the waiting area. The Indian Railway Stations Development Corporation Ltd. (IRSDC) is also working on other ideas like installing video game zones and virtual museums to make the station more passenger-friendly and commercially viable.The Gandhinagar railway station, scheduled to be inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi before the Vibrant Gujarat Summit in January 2019, is a special purpose vehicle (SPV) between the IRSDC and the Gujarat government. Around Rs 250 crore have been allocated for its redevelopment and the centre of attraction here will be a 300-room 5-star hotel built 22 metres above the ground, while the railway track will pass underneath it.

It is famous for its natural heritage that is the home for several wildlife animals, including 43 tigers, 15 panthers and around 1800 wild dogs.With an area of 625.40 sq km, the project includes Tadoba National, created in 1955 with an area of 116.55 sq km and Andhari wildlife sanctuary, created in 1986 with an area of 508.85 kms.It said that the tiger conservation in Tadoba national park was commendable for the last one and half decades. The tiger population has been increasing, though slowly, during the period. Population of the big cat in the area was 36 in 1994 census which has now increased by 43 in the last census.In view of its good track record, the Ministry of Environment and Forests also included the tiger reserve in its pilot project for mapping wildlife sanctuaries and parks by the Wildlife Institute of India, Dehradun. Rs 1.39-crore was sanctioned for the pilot project that would be completed in 36 months. Out of the five sites selected for this pilot project, three were tiger reserves - Tadoba-Andhari, Dudhwa and Corbett. The identified targets included generation of satellite data and securing the survey of India topographic maps.Talking to Hindustan Times, B Majumder, the PCCF (wildlife), and Maharashtra state said that by providing mobile and landline network, the park would certainly be able to benefit the tourists and forest personnel who are working there for wildlife conservation. “We are expecting more tourists after starting this facility,” he further claimed and informed that the BSNL was exploring to provide such facility in the locality.Meanwhile, the MTDC with the help of ministry and Railway and the ministry of Tourism is planning to start an exclusive narrow gauge vintage train from Nagpur to Nagbhir (near Tadoba) for tourists, an answer to the to Nagbhir (near Tadoba) for tourists, an answer to the Palace of Wheels in Rajasthan. The plan, which was postponed because of numerous reasons, would begin from January next.",1

521,"More MPs likely to quit parties in key Brexit weekThe prospect of more MPs quitting Conservative and Labour parties hung heavy over Westminster as Prime Minister Theresa May braced for a key week in parliament with a little over a month to go for the UK to leave the European Union on March 29.Labour deputy leader Tom Watson admitted on Sunday the party had to change to ensure more MPs do not take the extreme step of resigning, while May’s cabinet was under strain to maintain collective responsibility with three ministers openly, and others covertly, toeing new lines.Three cabinet ministers - business secretary Greg Clark, justice secretary David Gauke and works and pensions secretary Amber Rudd have already favoured extension to Article 50 to delay Brexit beyond March 29.May has been cautioned by senior advisors that she cannot sack ministers who vote this week to delay Brexit without causing a further rupture within her party, given the growing number of ministers and MPs reportedly in favour of delaying it.May used a party convention in Oxford to reiterate her position that has led to much hand-wringing inside and outside her party, as well as in Brussels: “Our focus to deliver Brexit must be absolute”.“We must not, and I will not, frustrate what was the largest democratic exercise in this country’s history. In the very final stages of this process, the worst thing we could do is lose our focus,” she said.As the newly-formed The Independent Group attracted funds from small and major donors worth “tens of thousands of pounds”, as former Labour MP Chuka Umunna put it, he called upon the British public to join the formation for a new kind of politics.He wrote in the Sunday Mirror: “This week we have come together in the national interest, to say ‘enough is enough’. We have each put everything on the line to give something new a try. Believe me, it wasn’t an easy decision for any of us”.“We don’t yet know the destination where the path we’ve taken will lead us. But what me and my Independent Group colleagues are absolutely clear about is that we cannot and must not recreate the old parties with their tribalism and incompetence”.",0
522,"More Staff For Railway Protection Force In Kashmir After Pulwama AttackThe Railway Protection Force (RPF) has increased the number of its personnel in Kashmir following the terror attack in Pulwama to ensure the safety of train passengers and to protect railway property, a senior official of the force said.A total of 40 CRPF personnel were killed and five injured on February 14 in a terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir when a Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammad suicide bomber rammed a vehicle carrying over 100 kg of explosives into their bus in Pulwama district.""We had a meeting with the Ministry of Home Affairs yesterday where the decision was taken to increase the presence of RPF in the region,"" said RPF DG Arun Kumar.""The chairman railway board also had a detailed security briefing with all zonal and divisional RPF officers on the security of railways. It was decided that a company of RPF will be sent to Kashmir for additional security,"" he said.While four companies of the RPF are stationed in Kashmir, one more, with 125 personnel, will be airlifted from Jammu to the area, he added.",1
523,"MoS Railways dubs Railway Protection Force as 'toothless', demands more power for it Dubbing the RPF as a ""toothless"" organisation, Minister of State for Railways Manoj Sinha on Wednesday strongly pitched for more powers for it even as his senior ministerial colleague Piyush Goyal played down his concerns, asserting that regardless of a law they should move on with their work Goyal also said an amendment to the existing Railways Act was only a ""technicality"", and urged the Railway Protection Force (RPF) and the Government Railway Police (GRP) to work together to secure railways and passengers. Speaking at a conference on security of railways, both Sinha and RPF Director General Arun Kumar pushed for handing over the registration, enquiry and detection of passenger-related crimes on board running trains to the force. Currently, even if a crime is detected by the RPF, the case has to be handed over to the GRP for further enquiry. RPF is a toothless organisation. It is involved in security, but has no powers. Despite ability and efforts, the RPF has not got the powers it deserves. However, it is blamed for everything that happens on railway premises. But the reality is that other than taking care (of railway property), RPF has no real powers. An amendment in the law, I personally feel, is the need of the hour,"" Sinha said However, Goyal asserted that ""whether the law is changed or not, whether the GRP does it or the RPF, these are all technicalities. We have to decide that we need to work together to secure passengers. Then law will not come in the way."" The RPF DG also highlighted how his force can leverage its inherent advantage of having an all India jurisdiction to prevent and detect crime in moving trains. Since the jurisdiction of an RPF posts cuts across jurisdiction of many police stations, it has an advantage of identifying place of occurrence, quick registration of the case and subsequent detection, Kumar added. ""Therefore, we may consider empowering RPF to register, investigate and detect passenger luggage thefts so that the state police can concentrate on checking serious crimes like robbery, dacoity, rape, murder and focus its efforts in maintenance of law and order in railway premises. ""A draft bill for amendment in Railways Act to empower RPF to register, enquire and prosecute cases of passenger luggage theft and crime against women has been approved to be sent to the cabinet for further legislative action,"" he said.

524,"MoU Signed For Development Of Railway Infrastructure In TelanganaIn the august presence of Chairman, Railway Board Shri A.K. Mital an Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between Ministry of Railways and State Government of Telangana for “Formation of Joint Venture Companies for Development of Railway Infrastructure in the State of Telangana” has been signed.On the event of Signing Ceremony, Chairman Railway Board Shri A. K. Mital, Member Engineering Shri V. K. Gupta, Member Staff Shri Pradip Kumar, Secretary Railway Board Shri R. K. Verma and other Board Members and Senior Officials were present. On behalf of the Railway Ministry Shri Ved Prakash Dudeja, Executive Director/Works signed the MoU whereas on behalf of Government of Telangana, Shri Sunil Sharma, Principal Secretary, Department of Transport, Roads & Buildings, Govt. of Telangana signed the MoU. Dr. Shashank Goel, Resident Commissioner, Govt. of Telangana was present among others. The MoU was signed in the backdrop of Railway Minister’s Budget announcement regarding setting up of Joint Ventures with States for focused project development, resource mobilization, land acquisition, project implementation and monitoring of critical rail projects.Speaking on the occasion, Chairman Railway Board stated that Railways has a big shelf of projects valuing about 3.5 lakh crore. Last year, Railways had sanctioned additional lines of nine thousand kilometres. There has always been lot of expectations from various States for new railway lines/lands. Thus, to meet the demands of the States, a Cabinet note was got approved for formation of JV Companies. He stated that 17 States have already consented for formation of JV Companies in their respective States and 5 States have already signed MoUs with Railway Ministry in this regard which are Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, Odisha. He stated that today’s MoU will help in putting the execution of railways projects on fast track.  He stated that this will also help to take into account the priorities of the States because these projects will be finalized in consultation with the States as there would be offices from State Governments as well as Railways in the new Company which will be formed.  He stated that this is very welcome step which takes the partnership of State and Centre together to take railway projects on very fast pace. Salient Features of the MoU:-  In view of the growing demands for railway lines in various states and huge requirement of funds to execute them, Minister for Railways announced in his budget speech regarding setting up of Joint Ventures with states for focused project development, resource mobilization, land acquisition, project implementation and monitoring of critical rail projects. 17 State Governments consented for formation of Joint Venture Companies in collaboration with the Ministry of Railways for development of rail infrastructure in their respective States. Draft MoU were sent to these State Governments and discussions were also held with them to clarify various provisions of the MoU.MoUs have already been signed by the Ministry of Railways with the State Governments of Odisha, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Kerala and Chhattisgarh.Today, MoUs are being signed with the State Governments of Telangana. This signing of MOU is going to be a stepping stone for formation of JV companies.The MoU envisages formation of a Joint Venture companies having 51% stakes of the respective State Government and 49% stakes of Ministry of Railways. Thus, the JV companies shall be fully owned by the Government. The companies will primarily identify projects and possible financing avenues in addition to Govt of India and the State Governments. After finances for a project are tied up, project specific SPVs or special purpose vehicles shall be formed. These SPVs can have other stake holders from Industries, Central PSUs, and State PSUs etc. However, the JV companies shall be mandatory stake holders with minimum 26% shares in the SPVs.The ministry of Railways will sign a concession agreement of 30 years with the project SPV for safe and sound operation, revenue sharing and providing technical & marketing logistics to the SPV. The revenue sharing shall be based on already established formula being used for inter zonal apportionment of revenue.The most important aspect of this MoU is that the ownership of the land shall vest with the SPVs which are a departure from previous practice. This will give financial leverage to the company to exploit commercial potential of the land. This is likely to result in making project viable which are otherwise not viable.At the end of concession period, the railways will have option to take over the assets at a nominal price. This is largely in line with average codal life of the assets as most of the assets will need large scale replacement after 30 years.Indian Railways has been playing a major role in national integration by connecting the remotest places and bringing people closer to each other. Railways receive a large number of demands for network expansion as a railway line acts as an engine of growth for the area it serves.However, Railways have a large shelf of ongoing New Line, Gauge Conversion and Doubling projects needing about Rs 3.5 lakh crores to complete. We have been trying to meet the aspirations of public within limited availability of funds.To expedite the projects, Railways have been trying to mobilize resources through other than Gross Budgetary Support. However, on the initiative of Minister for Railways Sh. Suresh Prabhu, Indian Railways have tied up funds for critical capacity enhancement project of doubling, third line, electrification etc. A MoU was signed with LIC of India and we have already taken first tranche of Rs 2000 Cr for these projects. This tied up loan will ensure dedicated and assured funding for such critical projects.Indian Railways have targeted to commission 2000 Km New Lines, 4000 Km Gauge Conversion and 11000 Km Doubling/Tripling/ Quadrupling projects over 5 years i.e. from 2015-16 to 2019-20. In 2015-16, we had kept quite ambitious target of commissioning 2500 Km Broad Gauge track. It is a matter of great satisfaction that we are poised to not only achieve these targets but to surpass them. We have already commissioned about 1300 Km Broad Gauge track till December, 2015 against 800 Km track commissioned in the corresponding period of the previous year (Due to monsoons, major commissioning takes place in the last quarter of the financial year).Formation of Joint Venture Companies with the State Governments will go a long way in faster commissioning of critical rail infrastructure projects as it will not only help in mobilization of funds but also in facilitating various clearances and land acquisition.",1

The handset instead uses light sensors to scan the veins in a user’s hand or to recognise their face.The phone’s front-facing camera, which uses a sensor chip developed by Germany’s Infineon Technologies , can scan in three dimensions - making it more secure than existing biometric methods of unlocking phones such as fingerprints.LG product evangelist David Montanya told a launch event it would be harder to ‘spoof’ than the FaceID feature used in Apple’s iPhone X because the vein structure in a user’s hand has less than one chance in a billion of being the same as anyone else’s.Users can also activate features with gestures - for example to play or pause a song or video, or adjust the volume, by twisting their fingers, emulating the character played by Tom Cruise in science-fiction detective thriller Minority Report.LG did not set release dates or announce prices for the new phones, but said the 5G model should hit stores in the first half of the year.",0
526,"Mumbai rail roko | Highlights: Protest called off, but agitators warn of another stir; train services resumeCommuters in Mumbai travelling on the Central Railway (CR)?struggled on Tuesday, after railway apprentices decided to protest against the railway recruitment system by resorting to rail roko between Matunga and Dadar railway stations on the main line during the morning rush hours.The railways select and appoint apprentices for various technical jobs, to be done in their various workshops across India. Earlier, these apprentices were absorbed into the railways as they got preference during recruitments. However, in 2016, the railway ministry decided to stop this and offer them just a 20% quota. Since then, ,many apprentices have not been able to get railway jobs and have been staging protests.Protesters on Tuesday blocked all the CR?lines, so both the slow and fast local train services ahead of Matunga have been shut completely, forcing commuters to walk on tracks. “Due to some agitation between Matunga and Dadar, rail traffic has been affected between Matunga and CSMT,” said Sunil Udasi, chief public relations officer, CR.The agitation started after 7am, and went on for around three-and-a-half hours.Here are the highlights:11.51am: Protesters head to Bandra (east), likely to meet MNS?chief Raj Thackeray at MIG Club.11.30am: Tracks cleared and trains running.

527,"Mumbai railway train commute is as noisy as an alarm clock ringing constantlyHear this. Your daily train commute on the Mumbai suburban railway is as noisy as an alarm clock ringing constantly, according to a study. While the study revealed that the Western Railway is the noisiest at 119.1 dB — as loud as a steel factory, the Central Railway is quieter, but only marginally, at 91.6dB.Non-governmental organisation (NGO) Awaaz Foundation measured noise using decibel meters from an old train between Bandra station and Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus (CST) on the harbour line, a new train between CST and Thane station and both old and new trains between Churchgate and Virar stations on the western line. While Virar station was the noisiest on the western line, Byculla station and Mahim junction were the noisiest on the harbour and central lines respectively.“Railway noise levels have been a huge source of stress, which has not been recognised up till now. After our readings were made public, complaints have been pouring in about how much it affects their daily life. This is just the beginning and there is a lot more to be done to reduce this source of noise pollution,” said Sumaira Abdulali, convener, Awaaz Foundation. “All types of travel are an integral part of people’s lives. The Centre needs to restrict noise levels on the suburban railways, like it has been done by the Airport Authority of India, which made the Mumbai airport a silent one.”Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) officials said that the readings were a cause for concern and pose a serious threat to people’s lives as they are exposed to such levels daily. “We will be raising the issue with the Union environment ministry and the railway ministry as noise readings close to 120dB is dangerous for even healthy people if they are exposed to it daily,” said D Saha, additional director, CPCB.",1
528,"Mumbai rain: Late trains, traffic snarls, water, scary wall collapse, et al. Mumbai came to a standstill on Monday -- just a few days after the onset of monsoon -- as overnight rains led to the usual chaos of delayed trains, water-logged roads, horrific traffic snarls, and a rather scary wall collapse in a central neighbourhood of the city. Four people have died in the last 24 hours in the city and its suburbs. A 15-year-old died after falling into an open pit in Malad. Another 13-year-old was killed in a wall collapse in thane. Two died yesterday when a tree collapsed on them near Azad Maidan in South Mumbai. A large part of the boundary wall of a plush apartment complex in Wadala collapsed and subsided in the morning, burying nearly a dozen cars. The damaged cars, mostly belonging to residents of the complex -- Lloyds  Estate -- were stuck in debris.Local trains, the city's life line, were running behind schedule as usual, at the hint of the first heavy rains this season. Water-logging was reported from low-lying areas and office-goers and vehicles found it difficult to navigate roads in large parts of the city.  Meanwhile, Mumbai's civic body officials placed pumps on stand-by in neighbourhoods that are prone to water-logging.  The Indian Meteorological Department has said that heavy to very heavy rains are expected to continue.Two people died and five were injured on Sunday after a tree fell on them near Metro Cinema at MG Road in South Mumbai's Marine Lines area, according to news agency ANI.A 13-year-old boy was killed and his parents were injured when an adjacent wall collapsed on their house at Wadol village in Ambernath taluka of Thane around 2:15 am today, the district civic body's regional disaster management cell chief Santosh Kadam told news agency PTI. In another incident, a 65-feet compound wall of a housing complex in Thane city collapsed this morning, crushing two cars and another vehicle, he said.  On Sunday, Mumbai recorded the highest amount of rainfall at 110.80 mm between 8:30 am and 4:30 pm, a Met department official said.",1
529,"Mumbai stampede: Tragedy is fallout of misplaced prioritiesIt is a sad irony. The stampede took place at Elphinstone Road station on the day railway minister Piyush Goyal was to visit Mumbai and get a first-hand experience of the struggle millions of daily commuters face as they commute between work place and home in overcrowded trains. In fact, the railway officials were also considering an event to rename Elphinstone Road station during Goyal’s visit to Mumbai on Friday, but it was somehow put on hold.For the past few years, commuters’ associations and activists have been raising the issue of overcrowded foot overbridges and narrow staircases at Parel and Elphinstone Road stations and warning the authorities that there could be a stampede-like situation here. The Hindustan Times published several reports on the subject. A plan for makeover of the two stations on two different suburban lines (central and western) joined by a narrow foot overbridge was prepared a few years ago. However, typically it was not given priority. On the other hand, a political demand to rename Elphinstone Road station as Prabhadevi was taken up on urgent basis and a notification was issued by the railway ministry in no time.Anybody who takes a glance at the two stations during morning and evening peak hours can tell there is an urgent need to rebuild their basic infrastructure. In fact, not just Parel and Elphinstone Road, but some other stations in central Mumbai have been witnessing similar problems. Following the redevelopment of mill land, in which defunct textile mills gave way to skyscrapers housing commercial offices, central Mumbai’s Parel-Worli belt became a commercial hub. Footfall at these stations saw a massive increase. The railway officials, however, are slow to react to the development and the outcome is there to see.Even the Maharashtra government and Mumbai civic body who gave permission for vertical development of central Mumbai should share the blame for the incident. Both the state and city governments were well aware of the development in the area, but did little to upgrade the infrastructure there.The incident also raises questions over the way the suburban railway network is governed by the railway ministry.The railway ministry is taking up projects such as air-conditioned trains, elevated railway corridors and above all, the Rs1,00,000-crore Mumbai-Ahmedabad bullet train. There could be a case for planning for the future, but what about the need to improve and upgrade basic infrastructure at railway stations? Shouldn’t that be a priority?Experts and commuters’ associations have been demanding there should be a separate cadre to handle the suburban train networks at mega cities like Mumbai, as the top railway officers often fail to understand how the Mumbai suburban section, which is used daily by over 7 million commuters, needs to be run. Maybe, it’s time to consider this demand as well.",1

After the approval, we will start identification of land. Banks will also be approached for loan,” said an MRVC official.With the expansion of the suburban railway network, the railway authorities have clubbed major projects under the umbrella of MUTP-3A. Procurement of 210 AC local trains, elevated corridor between CSMT- Panvel, too, are included in it. The project will increase the operational capacity of the western railway, further segregating suburban and long distance traffic up to Virar. It will also provide east-west connectivity to the extended suburbs of Mumbai.",1

Banks will also be approached for loan,” said an MRVC official.With the expansion of the suburban railway network, the railway authorities have clubbed major projects under the umbrella of MUTP-3A. Procurement of 210 AC local trains, elevated corridor between CSMT- Panvel, too, are included in it. The project will increase the operational capacity of the western railway, further segregating suburban and long distance traffic up to Virar. It will also provide east-west connectivity to the extended suburbs of Mumbai.",1

533,"Mumbai: Railways to evict illegal hawkers from entry and exit points of stations, FOBs In a bid to prevent incidents like the Elphinstone station stampede that claimed 23 lives, the railway administration has undertaken a drive to evict illegal hawkers from the entry and exit points of the station as well as from the foot overbridges to ease commuter movement.Twenty-three persons were killed in the stampede on a foot overbridge (FOB) linking two railways stations in Mumbai on Friday during the deadly rush hour. ""Though action against hawkers is undertaken on a regular basis, from October 1, this drive has been intensified with a combined operation launched by the RPF and GRP, and moreover they will also be patrolling the FoBs,"" said chief spokesperson of the Western Railway Ravinder Bhakar.However, passengers and railway representatives want permanent eviction of hawkers and have warned the railway officials that they would report to the Railways Minister if the hawkers return to do business at these spots.Bhakar said Western Railway administration is soon going to demarcate the railway area to stop this menace forever.He said, ""Most of the complaints against hawkers we receive, fall under the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) area where we do not have our administrative control. So we are blamed unnecessarily. Therefore, we have decided to demarcate our periphery and we will keep full vigil within our jurisdiction.""The Central Railway too has launched a drive against illegal hawkers at several stations including Ghatkopar, Kurla, Byculla, Mulund.Eviction of hawkers paved way for smooth movement of commuters near railway stations and on foot overbridges.Senior PRO of Central Railway A K Jain said, ""Though our security forces, keep driving away unauthorised hawkers, they have been now been asked to deal strictly with them.""Rajiv Singal, who has been a member of Railway Users Consultative Committees in Central Railway and Western Railway, however, dubs this exercise of evicting hawkers as merely an ""eyewash"".Singal said, ""This is simply dressing up and no permanent cure. It is showoff because audit team is doing their job and media pressure is working. I can bet you, hawkers will be back again.""""Until and unless, disciplinary action is not taken against the senior RPF officials in whose jurisdiction hawkers operate, nothing is going to change,"" Singal said.T N Dubey, former member of Divisional Railway Users Consultative Committees in Western Railway, said, ""If hawkers come back, we will write to the Railways Minister and draw his attention to the issue.""

537,"Odisha to implement PM-KISAN; farmers to benefit from central and state schemesChief minister Naveen Patnaik’s government had earlier been noncommittal on the PM’s farm intervention scheme as well.By MEERA MOHANTYBHUBANESHWAR: The Odisha government has agreed to implement the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN), deciding to share the first list of beneficiaries under its own farm-intervention programme for the Centre’s cash-transfer scheme. Chief minister Naveen Patnaik’s government, which had refused to implement the Ayushman Bharat central health insurance scheme, had earlier been noncommittal on the PM’s farm intervention scheme as well. The Centre is expected to formally launch the PM-KISAN scheme, announced in the interim budget 2019-20, at a farmers’ conclave in Gorakhpur in Uttar Pradesh on February 24. The onus on identifying beneficiaries for it has been placed with the states. Preoccupied with a state-wide rollout of its own Krushak Assistance for Livelihood and Income Augmentation (KALIA) scheme — it covers sharecroppers and landless agriculture labour as well — the state government had not decided who would qualify for the central scheme. On Thursday, the state announced it would share the list of 12.45 lakh small and marginal farmers who had received the first instalment of Rs 5,000 under the KALIA scheme. These farmers, holding up to 2 hectares of land, in the state now stand to gain an additional Rs 6,000 in three instalments through the year under the PM-KISAN scheme. Addressing a gathering of farmers at Sohela in Bargarh district, Patnaik on Thursday launched the Phase-II of KALIA. The scheme has been praised by economists for not being a loan waiver and including sharecroppers and landless farmers. Those with landholding get an assistance of Rs 25,000 (over five cropping seasons) while sharecroppers and the landless farmers get Rs 12,500 in three instalments. Patnaik’s said: “It is very sad that the Centre’s scheme does not have anything for these neglected and deprived sections (sharecroppers and landless farmers). I have taken up the issue with the Prime Minister and demanded steps for supporting the landless farmers, sharecroppers and agricultural workers and protecting their interests.” He also wanted the assistance to be enhanced from Rs 6,000 to Rs 10,000. The KALIA juggernaut — with posters, billboards, and conventions sweeping the countryside — has practically the entire state machinery occupied even as Patnaik’s Biju Janata Dal aims for a fifth-term in the government. The government’s latest announcement is KALIA scholarships. The state government, which claims to have already paid 16 lakh farmers, said on Thursday it distributed money to another 14 lakh small and marginal farmers.",0
538,"Opinion |?BJP needs another Modi waveWhat do the most recent state elections tell us about the likely fortunes of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the 2019 national election?The BJP lost the elections in all three of the Hindi belt states that went to the polls in November and December, including two states (Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh) it had controlled for 15 years. This continued a string of weaker-than-expected electoral performances (e.g., Bihar, Gujarat) in states where the BJP had a dominant performance in the 2014 national election.BJP partisans remind us that national elections are very different from state elections and that one should not extrapolate from these results — Modi’s charisma and popularity will loom large in 2019, they argue. Meanwhile, the Opposition sees these results as unmistakeable evidence that the BJP will be greatly weakened in 2019.Political punditry aside, what do state elections really tell us about national elections?It should be clear that state-level voter preferences play a major role even in national elections. Several state-level political parties such as the Trinamool Congress (TMC), the Biju Janata Dal (BJD) or the Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) are likely to win many seats in the Lok Sabha, even though they do not have clearly articulated national agendas. This is a natural consequence of the fact that a party’s capacity to deliver benefits and infrastructure such as roads and schools locally and the strength of the local party organisation are among the most significant determinants of a popularity (even in national elections) — and strong regional parties often perform well on these criteria. At the same time, charismatic leaders such as Indira Gandhi or Narendra Modi, and specific issues or policies like the Ram Janmabhoomi movement or the popularity of the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (NREGS) have helped the BJP or the Congress disproportionately in national elections.In some ways, a party’s performance in Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan is likely to be more predictive of the outcome even in national elections; they also do not have the coalition dynamics of Karnataka or Uttar Pradesh and are largely straight BJP/Congress contests. The BJP won state contests in Chhattisgarh, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh in 2007 and 2008, and also won these states in the 2009 national election, even in the face of a commanding performance by Congress nationally. The BJP won all four states in 2012 and 2013, and swept them in the 2014 national election. Of the 91 parliamentary constituencies (PCs) in these four states, the BJP won an eye-popping 88 seats, a strike rate of 97%. About 31% of all seats the BJP won in 2014 came from just these four states.Data from the Election Commission of India (ECI) allows the analysis of national election results down to state assembly constituency (AC) level.Chart 1 displays the AC-level vote share for the BJP in 2012 and 2013 state elections with the AC-level vote share for the BJP in the 2014 national election. There is clearly strong statistical relationship — state electoral results predict national results. For every 10% increase in AC-level vote share for the BJP in a state election, there is a roughly 5.7% increase in vote share in the 2014 national election. To be sure, the 2014 result was more than a repeat of past state results. It was a wave election, and Narendra Modi had a major effect. In these four states, the BJP had an average vote share of 45% in state elections but an average of 55% in the 2014 national election.This implies a Modi effect — the extra bump to BJP’s vote share in going from state to national elections — of about 10%. This 10% was not distributed uniformly, some areas saw much larger increases than 10% and some areas saw much less.Cut to the present situation. In 2017 and 2018, the average vote share of the BJP in state elections in these four states dropped to 41%. Given the poorer performance in these four states (it retained Gujarat and lost the other three), and the uneven distribution of the Modi effect, how will the BJP perform in 2019?Chart 2 displays the predicted number of seats in these four states in the 2019 national election using a statistical model accounting for the relationship between state and national results and the scale of the Modi effect (and its uneven distribution) — all based on how the 2012 and 2013 state election data predict the 2014 results.If there is a Modi effect at 2014 Modi wave levels, then the BJP can be expected to win about 83 seats in 2019, only five less than in 2014. But if the Modi effect drops to about 5% (that’s still a fairly large effect), then the BJP will only win about 65 out of the 91 seats in these four states.If there is no Modi effect, then the party will win just 37 seats.When combined with a stronger opposition coalition in Uttar Pradesh, the BJP will have a tough time returning to power in such a scenario.The BJP will need to repeat its commanding performance in these four states if it is to win again. No one can really say what will be the electoral impact of the BJP’s announcement of reservations for economically backward classes or the Pulwama attack.But this analysis underscores one simple point. The BJP will have to manufacture another Modi wave if it is to return to power in 2019.",0

See all the photos of JLo and Kareena’s matching looks before you say no.Kareena Kapoor might not have attended the 2019 Oscars. However, photos of the Bollywood actor’s stunning metallic dress from a recent awards function have everyone comparing her sparkly dress to one worn by actor-singer Jennifer Lopez at the 91st Academy Awards in Los Angeles on Monday. JLo might not have been nominated for an Oscar, but she made sure to leave quite the impression on the red carpet, dressed in head-to-toe sparkle, courtesy of fashion designer Tom Ford. For the star-studded occasion, JLo, who also presented an Oscar, teamed her shimmering metallic long-sleeved gown with sleek wavy hair and stunning diamond jewellery. Interestingly, Jennifer Lopez’s Oscars dress looks a lot like Kareena Kapoor’s equally mirrored and sparkling dress by Dubai-based fashion designer, Atelier Zuhra. Take a look JLo and Kareena’s silver dresses that screamed maximalist glamour:While these Jennifer Lopez and Kareena Kapoor dresses bear obvious resemblance to one another — both have mock necks, which elongate their silhouettes — JLo’s shiny floor-length look is (as expected) more red carpet than Kareena’s sleeveless ankle-length dress. JLo’s figure-hugging Tom Ford gown was covered in mosaic mirrored tiles and glistened under the bright lights on the red carpet of Hollywood’s biggest night. Jennifer Lopez added even more shine to her glam by wearing a chunky diamond ring and matching earrings.Kareena Kapoor’s fitted dress, which she wore to the Social Media Summit and Awards 2018 in November, was also decorated with mosaic crystal embellishments, but offered a more fun, party vibe. It featured Atelier Zuhra’s signature shattered mosaic crystal mirrors — inspired by Barcelona’s Gaudí architecture. Another similarity between Kareena and Jennifer’s looks? Their make-up. Both JLo and Kareena wore a dramatic smoky eye to complement their metallic dresses. While, the jury is still out on whether Jennifer Lopez’ Tom Ford gown was inspired by Kareena Kapoor’s Atelier Zuhra design, our guess is not — considering both JLo and Tom Ford don’t need much inspiration to churn out fashion gold (or silver).",0
540,"Pakistan’s house of cards: How its purported aces have been trumpedSome of Pakistan’s purported aces have been trumped by New Delhi over the years, others have been neutralised, and some have outlived their utility. Here are nine cards Pakistan has played against India.By Chidanand RajghattaPakistan has used various “trump” cards over the decades to stalk and stall India’s growth fuelled by being an open, democratic and plural society despite some recent challenges. Some of Pakistan’s purported aces have been trumped by New Delhi over the years, others have been neutralised, and some have outlived their utility. Here are nine cards Pakistan has played against India. The American Card: Used from the time Pakistan was formed when its leaders quickly allied with Washington even as India stumbled into the Soviet orbit. The end of the Cold War, the collapse of the Soviet Union, India’s economic reforms and subsequent growth, the Kargil war, and 9/11 (which had Pakistan’s fingerprints on it) resulted in Pakistan losing this hand. The Afghan Card: Fearful of India’s size and growing heft, Pakistan has long sought “strategic depth” in Afghanistan by installing a friendly, puppet regime in Kabul, a strategy that resulted in the coming to power of Taliban in 1996 (and eventually led to 9/11). But Pakistani overreach built on a Sunni-Wahhabi construct has ruined this card. Except in Taliban pockets, Pakistan is now despised by most Afghans who see it as a malign force. The Kashmir Card: A card the Pakistan military and its elites have played since 1947 to corner resources. Most poor Pakistanis care squat about Kashmir, which is “cash mere” for the Pakistani military as it dips its hand in the till. The Pakistani establishment continues to lie to its own people about UN Resolution (47) on Kashmir (which actually enjoins that Pakistan should first withdraw from the areas it has occupied before other steps). With the passage of time, changes in demographics etc, the resolution, which was non-binding in the first place, is now infructuous. But Pakistan won’t accept it because peace would mean having to whittle down its military budget. The Saudi Card: In this petro dollars-for-nuclear cover deal, the House of Saud has long backed and bankrolled Pakistan, acquiring an outsized influence on its domestic politics to the extent that it is a go-to place for Pakistanis in retirement or exile. But Saudis themselves have embarked on a nuclear quest, and India’s growing influence (it has greater number of workers and white collar workers) means Pakistan’s influence is being reduced down despite Ummah solidarity. As Crown Prince Salman suggested to his hosts last week, when living next to the world’s #3 and #2 economies Pakistan would benefit from peace. The Muslim Ummah Card: Over the years, Pakistan has presented itself as a champion of the Islamic world and has singularly prevented India from acquiring even an observer status in the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), whose associates go beyond the 50-Muslim majority countries in the world (Russia and Thailand for instance have observer status). India, which has the world’s second largest Muslim population after Indonesia, has gradually increased its influence in the the Islamic world (particularly in the Gulf), and a breakthrough is inevitable. But its task will be made difficult if the Hindutva hotheads at home run amuck. The Russia Card: As India has gravitated towards the United States and Pakistan has lost traction in Washington, Islamabad has tried to woo countries such as Russia, Turkey and even Iran in the hope of strengthening its China card. But it is a weak hand. Pakistan is so caught up in domestic radicalisation and internecine bloodletting that few countries have any confidence in its long-term prospects. And despite India’s on-again, off-again ties with these countries, New Delhi interest and influence on account of its economic heft. The China Card (and for China, Pakistan Card): China finds it useful to constrain India using Pakistan. The day India begins to use demographic, economic and cultural clout, the usefulness of this card could diminish. Just think of all the Chinese phones we buy, the general size of the Indian market. China will also not want to import Pakistan’s radicalisation into its sensitive Xinjiang province. The Terrorism Card: Pakistan’s most potent card, an extension of its “death by thousand cut” policy following its defeat in the 1971 war. India’s weaknesses, including in its security doctrine, and global indifference, had enabled Pakistan to export terror (its principal export) and get away, literally, with murder. New Delhi has failed to sensitise world capitals of Pakistani fingerprints on not just terror attacks in India but in many other places across the world. The Nuclear Card: Pakistan’s ultimate trump card that gives cover to its terrorism, one that India failed to take care of between 1971 and 1984 by which time it was too late. The Nuclear Card: Pakistan’s ultimate trump card that gives cover to its terrorism, one that India failed to take care of between 1971 and 1984 by which time it was too late. Remarkably, Pakistan does not have a Pakistan card. The world’s sixth most populous nation has the sixth largest army (and is a nuclear power to boot), but its economy is ranked 24th in size. Maharashtra has a larger economy, and Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Gujarat will each overtake it soon. Nearly Nearly ten times the size of Pakistan’s economy, India is adding one Pakistan to its GDP each year, and will have an economy roughly 40 times larger by 2050. This growing imbalance is actually what makes the Pakistani military reckless in its support of terrorism. New Delhi has only one card – the India card. Playing a cool, calculated, and cohesive hand, while quietly attriting Pakistan, economically and through covert payback, without the hysteria, histrionics and grandstanding currently on display, will yield better results. The Pakistani house of cards will inevitably collapse.",0
541,"Panel wants railway ministry to create body to regulate faresA parliamentary committee wants the railway ministry to create the body it has long promised to, that will, among other things, regulate fares.In its latest report, the Railway Convention Committee of Parliament maintained that since the proposed authority is yet to take a final shape, “consideration of suitable subsidy sharing mechanism is yet to begin.”Parties in power rarely increase passenger fares, irrespective of the carrier’s financial health , given the political ramifications of such a move. The idea to set up an independent body to suggest fare hikes and other reforms was mooted during the United Progressive Alliance’s (UPA) tenure.In April 2017, the NDA government first approved the setting up of the Rail Development Authority (RDA), to make “Pricing of services commensurate with costs, suggest measures for enhancement of Non Fare Revenue, protection of consumer interests, by ensuring quality of service and cost optimization, promoting competition, efficiency and economy”, among other things.The RDA didn’t start functioning and railway ministry officials recently suggested that the creation of the body could take even more time, with parliamentary elections around the corner.The House panel, led by BJD’s Bhartruhari Mahtab, noted that “in view of the fact that the principals of sharing subsidies/ social costs involve reimbursement of such costs to the railways by finance ministry and other departments, the committee stress that the process of establishment of the proposed Railway Regulatory Authority be expedited.”The Parliamentary panel supported the idea of the merger of the rail budget with the general budget—a practice started since 2017—but expressed concern that a decision to demarcate between commercial and social activities of the Indian rail and the reimbursement of the social service obligation has not been done so far.",1
542,"Pepper traders cite Sri Lankan minister statement on illegal imports to IndiaIn a letter to the commerce minister, pepper consortium has raised concerns over spurt in illegal imports of Vietnam pepper.ET Bureau|Feb 12, 2019, 07.57 PM ISTKOCHI: The pepper traders have appealed to the commerce ministry to take steps to raise vigil to prevent the import of pepper from Vietnam through Sri Lanka with origin of certificate from the latter, citing the recent statement by a Sri Lankan minister in media. Kishore Shamji, the coordinator of the Kerala chapter of Indian Pepper and Spice Traders, Growers , Planters Consortium said in a letter to commerce minister Suresh Prabhu that Sri Lankan minister has said that he hasn’t been able to prevent the export of 156 containers of Vietnam pepper to India with certificate of origin from Sri Lanka as it is a racket similar to narcotics trafficking. ``We have been cautioning the Indian government since last week of January that 180 containers of about 1800 to 2000 tonnes of such pepper have left Sri Lankan coast,’’ he said.. This is over and above the pepper smuggled to India from Myanmar, Bangladesh and Nepal, he added The supply of Vietnam pepper is happening by evading duty to the tune of 43% as the duty for import from Vietnam is 51% against 8% for Sri Lanka under India Sri lanka Free Trade Agreement, circumventing the minimum import price of Rs 500 per kg fixed by India for pepper imports. Shamji said the Indian importer pays the minimum import price of Rs 500 ($ 7100 per tonne), for which duty comes to Rs 40 at 8%. Since the Sri Lankan pepper price is $ 3000 per tonne, the balance $4100 is in many cases not remitted. Those who are paying $ 7100 in full gets back the excess money through hawala in cash in Indian rupees. ` In both cases it is a violation of FEMA rules,’’ he alleged. He said such pepper are sold in Indian markets below the domestic price of Rs 350 per kg. Shamji urged the authorities to enforce steps to test for a minimum of 6% piperine content in such imports if it is for extraction purpose. The Vietnam pepper has only 4 to 5 % of piperine, he said.",0
543,"PM-KISAN to provide multiple benefits to farmers: CEAThe average income of farmers in 2015-16 was about Rs 30,000 and, hence, Rs 6,000 would be 20 per cent.PTI|Feb 17, 2019, 12.12 PM ISTNEW DELHI: Farm income support scheme PM-KISAN will provide multiple benefits to farmers, including improving their credit worthiness, said Chief Economic Adviser K V Subramanian. The Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi Yojana (PM-KISAN) was announced in the Interim Budget 2019-20, under which Rs 6,000 will be given in three instalments to 12 crore small and marginal farmers holding cultivable land up to 2 hectare. Producer support in India is very low compared to the other countries and the scheme will help in supplementing that, he told PTI. ""Across countries, producer support for farmers are quite high. The recent OECD study which talks about producers support in India is quite low. ""This section is the one which will be feeding 125 crore mouths and you have a population which is growing at less than 1 per cent and food production is growing at greater than 3 per cent,"" he said. Therefore, Subramanian said, there will be surpluses leading to fall in prices impacting income of farmers. Moreover, he said, the reason farming is supported in a lot of countries is that the risk-return trade-off is bad in the sector. ""Therefore, this constituent required support. There is definitely a case for supporting in a way that does not create distortion,"" he said. The other important benefit of this scheme is in terms of making farmers credit worthy as financial institutions have assured cash flow for this vulnerable section, he said. The average income of farmers in 2015-16 was about Rs 30,000 and, hence, Rs 6,000 would be 20 per cent, Subramanian said. ""If you have assured cash flow, banker can collateralise that and lend to the farmer up to Rs 24,000 in a year. ""Three four times of a Rs 6,000 assured income can be given to farmers by using the microfinance. What is important is that this is an assured return which has not been done so far. This is something financial institutions can indeed use,"" he added. It will have multiple benefits as it starts from basic premise that you need to be supporting an important constituent of economy which is vulnerable, he said, adding that it is something which is important. Prime Minister Narendra Modi will formally launch the scheme at a farmers' rally in Gorakhpur, Uttar Pradesh, on February 24. The data uploaded on the PM-KISAN portal till February 24 will be considered for transfer of the first instalment at the launch event and the second instalment will be given from April 1.",0

547,"Private players allowed only in infrastructure: Rail MinistryThe Railway Ministry on Wednesday said it has so far allowed infrastructure related investments in the rail sector, which is consistent with the government policy.Reacting to reports on private investment in the rail sector, the ministry said investment in container business was only to the extent of ownership of rolling stock and provision of container services as distinct from operation of such trains, which would be carried out by Indian Railways.As per the government's industrial policy, only railway transport is reserved for the public sector. Rail transport is defined as operation of freight and passenger trains and does not include ownership of track, rolling stock and other related infrastructure, the ministry said in a statement.It also said foreign direct investment up to 100 per cent is permitted under the automatic route in railway infrastructure as long as train operations were not involved.",1
548,"Privatisation must cover the whole rail sector, not just the railwaysEvery indicator, not just safety-related ones, underlines the travails of Indian Railways (IR). An instant solution is also offered. Every monopoly is inefficient, especially a public sector one. Liberalise, privatise, corporatise. Isn’t that how railways were developed in India, through private sector initiatives in the 19th century? Let’s leave aside history, where, the private sector didn’t exactly smell of roses. What do we mean by privatisation and what do we mean by IR? There is an IR that owns infrastructure (tracks, signalling, rolling stock, stations) and there is an IR that runs trains. There is also an IR that runs schools and hospitals, but since this is a non-core function, let’s just assume, eventually, IR sheds that. By privatisation, we may either mean private entry, or selling IR’s equity.Most services on trains and stations (cleaning, catering and maintenance) are already privatised. There is little IR does departmentally. Wagons are produced by the private sector. So, increasingly, are coaches and locomotives. What most people mean by private entry is the private sector running trains. On this, will we contemplate locomotive drivers from the private sector and safety (not to be confused with security) handled by the private sector? That’s worth thinking about. On privately run trains, most people don’t know policy already allows that. Why don’t we see them? There have been private luxury trains. On mainstream trains, there are two reasons. First, there has to minor tweaking of legislation to permit the private sector to charge fares and those fares, after the regulator has been set up, have to be reasonable. Second, any train, public or private, requires a path, from point A to point B. Today, capacity constraints are such that it is impossible to provide that path, for both passenger and goods trains. Sure, after freight corridors, capacity constraints will ease a bit. But fundamentally, easing requires huge investments, which IR’s present financial woes don’t allow. If you want to run a private train from Jodhpur to Jaisalmer, I am sure IR will find you a path. However, that’s not a remunerative segment. The private sector will be interested in high-density corridors, where there are capacity issues. Eventually, when private trains take off, they will run in those high density corridors. Who runs trains elsewhere? Will there be something like a universal service obligation? As a final element in private entry, what about stations? Private management of stations is one thing, private development is another. Private development requires a revenue model. Without land for commercial real estate development (like Delhi and Mumbai airports), it won’t work. At best, given distribution of IR land, this might happen for around 15 stations and no more.Let’s turn to privatisation through selling IR’s equity. Everything isn’t like IRCTC, IRCON or IRFC. A major problem is lack of proper commercial accounting in IR. Before buying something, you need to know its worth. Today, this isn’t possible. With successful pilots in zones/divisions already undertaken, there is no reason why the entire IR system shouldn’t have proper commercial accounting in the next two years. After that, production units (for manufacturing rolling stock) can certainly be hived off. There is no convincing market failure argument for these. But on infrastructure interpreted as tracks, signalling and related matters, all railways have a historical evolution and models imported from elsewhere can’t be easily implanted. It is a vertically and horizontally integrated structure, notwithstanding initial independent and regional developments in 19th century. Therefore, unbundling and privatising this is an expensive and pointless proposition. Once you have taken away the infrastructure, in the form of something like an IR Infrastructure Corporation, and hived off production units and non-core functions, what is left in the IR bit that runs trains, especially after private entry? There is nothing left to privatise there.",0
549,"Rabi cereals production to fall by nearly 10%: NBHCThis coupled with the drought in some parts have impacted Rabi sowing and could aggravate the distress in the farm sector.By Jayashree BhosaleAccording to the first estimate of rabi production in 2018-19, National Bulk Handling Corporation (NBHC), rabi cereals production is expected to decline by 9.91%, while chana/gram is the most affected pulse seeing 9.92% fall in acreage. ""As per our study, the total rabi cereals production for the year 2018-19 is expected to be lower by 9.91 per cent to 115.49 Million MT and wheat is expected to show a decline in area by 2.54 per cent to 29.66 Million Ha and production by 4.99 per cent to 94.72 Million MT owing to scanty and inequitable distribution of rainfall in major growing areas,"" an NBHC release said. The northeast monsoon, between October and December, over the country had been “Substantially below Normal”. The cumulative rainfall in the country during the post-monsoon season i.e. 01st October 2018 to 31st December 2018 has been 44 per cent lower than LPA. Rainfall in the four broad geographical divisions of the country during the above period have been lower than LPA by 51 per cent each in Central India & East & North East India, 45 per cent in North West India and 36 per cent in South Peninsula. This coupled with the drought in some parts have impacted Rabi sowing and could aggravate the distress in the farm sector. The southwest monsoon was almost 22 per cent below normal in the Marathwada region of Maharashtra, while in north interior Karnataka, the deficit was almost 29 per cent and 37 per cent below normal in Rayalseema. In Maharashtra, Vidarbha reported 88 per cent post-monsoon rainfall deficiency, which is the highest in the state. Similarly, drought affected regions like Marathwada received 84 per cent less rainfall, followed by central Maharashtra at 64 per cent deficiency and Konkan and Goa at 56 per cent rainfall deficiency in the post-monsoon period. According to NBHC, rabi rice acreage is recorded lower by 14.17 per cent and its production is expected to decrease significantly by 28.91 per cent due to major rice-growing states West Bengal, Odisha, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh are lagging sowing area. Total coarse cereals are expected to fall by 6.9 per cent to 12.1 million MT in 2018-19. This is due to a fall in production of Jowar, maize and barley. Jowar has seen the biggest fall in sowing, with around 2.52 million hectares, a fall of 18.82 per cent over last year. Area sown under maize and barley fell by 5.67 per cent and 2.62 per cent, respectively. NBHC has maintained that the most affected is the cultivation of pulses, particularly gram or chana. The acreage under gram is down in major growing States of Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Karnataka, which is reeling a drought. The gram acreage has decrease by 9.92 per cent to 9.70 million hectares from 10.76 million hectares in last year. Overall, the pulses have shown decrease by 6.75 per cent and the production is expected at 14.48 Million MT despite kulthi acreage and production increase significantly by 29.84 per cent and 31.23 per cent respectively. Masoor production is estimated 1.76 per cent lower at 1.71 Million MT as against 1.74 during 2017-18. ""However, oilseeds are the only crop which managed to retain last year’s level in terms of acreage with less than one per cent increase. A surge in mustard cultivation in Rajasthan has been critical in taking the total oilseeds sowing area to about 8.04 million hectares, which was 0.71 per cent higher than that in 2017-18. Mustard acreage is expected to increase by 5.03 per cent at 7.02 million hectares likewise production is expected to increase by 4.46 per cent to 8.69 million MT. Groundnut, Sunflower and safflower production for 2018-19 has been estimated to be lower at 0.97 million MT.,"" observed NBHC in its estimate.",0
550,"Rail budget to signal road to reform, says minister Suresh PrabhuThe railway budget will signal the direction of long-term reforms needed to revamp the world's fourth-largest rail network, minister Suresh Prabhu said on Thursday. ""The budget will set the direction of long and difficult road of reform,"" Prabhu told state-run broadcaster DD News ahead of his budget presentation.All eyes will be on Prabhu on Thursday on whether he will raise passenger fare and freight rates in his maiden rail budget to boost the cash-crunched railways and include proposals for Make in India initiatives besides enhancing safety and security.Minister of state for railway Manoj Sinha had earlier ruled out a reduction in fares in the context of falling diesel rates but Prabhu is expected to make a tight rope walk as he tries to bridge the huge gap in finances while presenting the budget in Lok Sabha.Prabhu is likely to unravel his grand plans of how to decrease the cross-subsidy for passenger service from freight earnings which is touching Rs 24,000 crore and the steps to increase goods transportation share in the national transporter with or without hiking fares.India's decrepit state-run train services stand to receive at least a 25% boost in investment to over $9 billion, funded solely by falling fuel costs, according to officials familiar with the railway budget.The world's fourth largest rail network could get even more if Prime Minister Narendra Modi makes it a priority, as China did during its rapid economic growth over the past two decades.There are high hopes that his nine-month-old government will plough money into investment in infrastructure needed to haul the economy out of a rut when it presents its first annual federal budget on Saturday.The rail budget could show how far Modi's India is prepared to drive investment in a vital transport sector.""The fall in diesel prices and a pick-up in freight earnings have given us a golden chance to raise investments,"" said one government official.An increase in the budget allocation would go some way to offset disappointment at the lack of private sector interest in investing in railways, after Modi's government last year suggested public-private partnerships for new routes.",1
551,"Rail budget: There’s a lot riding on rail modernisationSuresh Prabhu covered a lot of ground in his railway budget setting out four goals, five drivers and 11 thrust areas for his ministry. First the good news: No new trains or projects were announced, which means that already crowded tracks will not be further burdened and we will see an improved punctuality of passenger and goods trains. The bad news is that he has shied away from hiking passenger fares which remain abysmally low at Rs 0.30 per km, lower than Delhi Metro’s fare of Rs 1 per km.Leading the 11 ‘thrust areas’ is ‘quality of journey’ for the passengers ranging from providing 17,000 bio-toilets in coaches to 650 new toilets at various stations. He has promised e-catering on 108 trains for passengers to get the food of their choice, apps for train bookings, improved access for the disabled, new helplines for women and the facility to purchase a ticket online in five minutes!He also proposed more satellite terminals to reduce overcrowding of existing ones, but has pinned his hopes on the PPP (Public Private Partnership) model which is a highly indeterminate option and could result in turning over Railways’ land to property dealers. Some new innovations include setting up electronic displays at 2000 major stations to show real time status of trains, of course with private participation which would lead to advertising, adding to the cacophony and noise pollution on platforms.Booking tickets 120 days in advance will undoubtedly help citizens to plan in advance, but a higher penalty for last minute cancellation of booking would have also helped to discourage touts who manage to block tickets during the busy festival season.Prabhu has placed great faith in union transport, highways and shipping minister Nitin Gadkari who would help him with providing rail connectivity to ports. For improving rail safety he has drawn heavily on the Anil Kakodkar report proposing the ATP (Automatic Train Protection) system which will be very expensive.Plans are afoot for roping in PSUs to partner the Railways in providing better connectivity to transport their raw material and finished products such as coal, steel and cement. Prabhu has claimed a good preliminary response but how much this will translate into reality remains to be seen.Businesses will welcome proposals for automatic fare rebate for loading wagons on (empty) return journeys. But the results could be mixed since matching consignments with availability of empty wagons will not be easy and could also result in higher wagon turnround affecting operational efficiency.Suresh has promised to build 970 RUBs (Road Under Bridge) and ROBs (Road Over Bridge) to eliminate unmanned level crossings that caused accidents.Setting up a Logistics Corporation will usher in an era of greater involvement by the Railways in multi-modal transport by setting up new facilities at hundreds of disused goods sheds. Undoubtedly partnering with major private logistics providers will be crucial for the success of the scheme.The only redeeming feature of this year’s rail budget is the fact that at last realisation has dawned on the powers that be, that populism has to give way to pragmatism for regaining the financial health of the nation’s economic life line and a crucial engine of growth!The size of the Plan Budget has gone up by 52% from Rs. 65,798 crore in 2014-15 to Rs 1,00,011 crore in 2015-16. Support from the central government constitutes 41.6% of the total Plan budget and internal generation 17.8%, perhaps the best financial indicator to ensure that the Railways will at last be moving on the right track.",1

We have to move merely providing rail infrastructure to other support services such as technology up gradation, better logistic support and better passenger services in an integrated manner,  said  Rajen Gohain, Minister of State for Railways, while inaugurating an ASSOCHAM conference on ‘ASSOCHAM International Summit on Invest Rail .’ “Need of the hour in Indian Railways is the massive investment and new technology without which we cannot move to become a world class transporter. Thus, the plan is to increase investment to nearly one trillion rupees in the next decade”, said Mr Rajen Gohain. Thus, Rail is the right forum for investment that can address nearly all investments challenges such as ensuring reduced global warming, volatile fuel costs, having lower energy consumption, reducing urban congestion, having less land usage, servicing an aging population and making transportation accessible to all ages across all income brackets. In addition, rail has lower infrastructure renewal and maintenance cost which is often mentioned as 20 times lower per ton kilometre that other forms. “Investment in rail will thus help in the planets sustainable and environmental goals and help in meeting the greenhouse gas emission targets. In addition, rail offers a more stable and sustainable form of transportation. We, in Indian Railways, are thus trying to have a collaborative approach in bringing governments, local authorities, railways and other stakeholders on the same wave length for a more sustainable form of transport system”, mentioned Mr. Gohain. Investing in rail stimulates the economy while reducing CO2 emissions and urban congestion. As many countries worldwide plan to step up their investments in rail over the next decade, we in Indian Railways can and must do more. While India has the world’s fourth largest rail network, it has been outstripped by /china, which now has more than six times as much track following an intensive expansion and modernisation of its network over the past two decades. We are thus also looking in using PPP more- or as articulated in the coming years. We aim to keep people at the centre of all our activities and investments in our journey, said Railway Minister. Indian Railways has one of the biggest network in the world and is recognised as one of the largest organisation under single management. It is also an admitted fact that for the past couple of centuries, transportation has fuelled the world’s economy. In this context, for the country’s economic and environmental health, it is thus time to restore the balance between road, air and rail. Others who also spoke during the conference were H.E.

The allies of main political party used to demand the railway ministry to join the government. The party which came to power at Centre also used the railway ministry as a bargaining tool to distribute trophies to its allies. This is a bitter truth,"" he said. ""Leaders from political parties who got the control of the railways were not interested in (development of) railways and I need not say what they were interested in,"" Modi said.The Prime Minister today laid the foundation stone for redevelopment of Gandhinagar railway station, which will get a face-lift at a cost of Rs 250 crore and will have a 300-room five star hotel built atop.""My government has given priority to railways... it should expand, it should be developed, get modernised and it should bring a qualitative change in the lives of common people.”""We have tried to do this in the last two years and five months. We have increased the budget of railways to double of what it was,"" he said.Modi listed various works done by his government to develop railways and said the pace of doubling of railway tracks has increased, besides speeding up of gauge conversion and electrification of lines. He said free WiFi has been provided at railway stations.The Central government is working to increase speed of trains and also striving to bring in global technology to make railways safer, as ""safety is of greatest concern"", Modi said.""In developed countries, 70 per cent goods transportation is carried out by railways while rest by roads. However in India, 15 to 20 per cent is through railways while 70 to 80 per cent is by roads. Goods tend to get costlier when transported by roads. We are stressing on development of freight corridors,"" he said.The Prime Minister also said that railway stations located in cities can be developed by constructing high-rise buildings atop them.Gandhiangar railway station will be redeveloped through a special purpose vehicle (SPV) formed between the Gujarat government and the Indian Railway Stations Development Corporation Ltd (IRSDC). The proposed name of the SPV is Gandhinagar Railway & Development Corporation Ltd.The project includes redevelopment of the railway station as well as the construction of a 300-room five star hotel atop the station. The hotel, with three towers, will be around 65 metres tall.Railway Minister Suresh Prabhu said his ministry is planning to replicate such redevelopment at 23 railway stations across the country.",1
563,"Railways agents misused demonetisation waivers: CAGIn November 2016, 132 Indian Railways’ Jansadharan Ticket Booking Sewaks (JTBS) took unfair advantage of a three-day-long waiver facility provided by the government to allow transactions at railway ticketing counters after the shock demonetisation order of November 8, and deposited unusually big quantities of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 currency notes on the three subsequent days, a CAG report has found out.The 132 JTBS were from the Central, Eastern, Northeast Frontier, North Eastern, North Western and Western Railway (CR, ER, NFR, NER, NWR and WR) zones. On November 9, 2016, the Railway Board, had issued a directive that the Rs500 and Rs 1,000 bank notes would not cease to be legal tender from November 9, 2016 until November 11, 2016, to the extent of transactions at railway ticketing counters for purchase of tickets, for which complete records were required to be maintained.The CAG report said: “Audit test checked the transactions carried out by 132 JTBSs during 07 November 2016 to 11 November 2016 on 59 stations of six Zonal Railways. A comparison of deposits made by the JTBSs for five days of pre and post demonetisation revealed that post demonetization, total cash deposited by these 132 JTBSs exceeded their normal pre-demonetization cash deposit by significant amounts…”The national auditor observed — “No specific directives/instructions were issued by the Railway Board in respect of cash deposited by the JTBSs in Railway’s Deposit Accounts essential for issue/sale of unreserved tickets through computerised Unreserved Ticketing System. 132 JTBS in six Zonal Railways took undue advantage of the facility provided by the Government of India to allow transactions at railway ticketing counters and deposited specified bank notes with the Railways post demonetisation instead of depositing the cash in the banks”.Started in 2008 in order to cut down long queues at railway stations, the JTBS scheme permits an individual to sell railway tickets outside railway stations. The JTBS charges Rs 1 per ticket but can sell only unreserved tickets and cannot issue concession tickets. ",1
564,"Railways begin work on export policyIndian Railways is working on an export policy under which top officials from the country’s coach factories will be able to visit other countries to seek bulk orders for train coaches. The absence of an export policy has impeded the ability of state-run factories to seek regular overseas orders, after executing the last order for coaches, from Sri Lanka, in 2010-12.The railways is looking at Southeast Asia, the Middle East and Africa for potential customers under the proposed policy, seeking alternative sources of revenue by capitalising on the cost advantage offered by its coach factories, which build train cars up to a fifth cheaper than overseas competitors. The policy will empower officials of the rank of general managers and above to take decisions and sew up deals quickly.“Manufacturing coaches is one part where we have good capacity and we can maintain international standards as well. Also, the cost per coach will be 20-25% less than what is there in other parts of the world. If a policy is in place, we will be able to take frequent orders and our officials won’t have to take approval for every decision. They will be free to take decisions,” said Rajesh Aggarwal, member (rolling stock) of the Railway Board.Aggarwal said that even to travel abroad, an official now needs to seek approval from the railway ministry and Railway Board.“We have been doing exports through RITES, but with export policies, we will be able to take direct orders,” Railway board chairman Ashwani Lohani said. RITES is a state-run consulting company that specialises in transport infrastructure.Railways recently exported the first set of Diesel Electric Multiple Units to Sri Lanka from Integral Coach Factory (ICF) in Chennai. ICF has exported coaches and coach components to various countries like Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan, Vietnam, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Tanzania, Mozambique, Angola, Nigeria and Uganda.“ICF is expecting another order from Sri Lanka railways for export of 160 coaches and the modalities are being worked out along with RITES Ltd. Advanced levels of negotiations are going on between Indian Railways and Bangladesh Railways for export of coaches from ICF,” said S Mani, general manager of ICF.Railway is prepared to manufacture both standard and meter gauge coaches and Modern Coach Factory at Raebareli in Uttar Pradesh is being expanded to increase capacity.“The capacity of coach factory in Indian Railway is good and underdeveloped countries can be a good market for India. But quality should be maintained in order to get good revenue,” said RK Singh, former chairman of the Railway Board.",1

567,"Railways Minister flying high on taxpayers moneyUnion Ministers are busy people, and perennially unsure of their schedule. Or so it would seem from the considerable bill run up by the Union Railways Minister on charter planes and multiple bookings.As part of a series on the misuse of public funds by various ministries of the government of India, an investigation into the workings of the Railways Ministry reveals that rail officials frequently have bent rules to provide charter planes to Union Railways Minister Piyush Goyal since he got the portfolio in September 2017. This has cost the public exchequer 15-20 times more than what it would have cost for the minister to board regular planes.A Railways rule underlines that the Railways can hire a charter plane or helicopter only in case of railway accidents. A minister cannot hire a charter plane for official business unless he is inspecting an accident site.It is also worth noting that Narendra Modi had invoked austerity measures soon after his swearing-in as Prime Minister in 2014. The rulebook states that all government officials including ministers have to fly Air India unless flights are not available in emergency situations. However, Railways officials let Piyush Goyal and his two junior ministers in the Railways, take private airlines instead of Air India.In addition to this, the Minister’s office buys two to three air tickets for the same destination on a given day just to ensure that Goyal doesn’t miss his flight. This expense is paid by the Railways, so essentially it is at the expense of Indian taxpayers.In September 2017, within days of swearing-in as Union Railways Minister, Piyush Goyal’s office put out a request for hiring a charter plane to travel from Delhi to Surat and later Mumbai. In response to the request for hiring a charter plane, Additional General Manager, Northern Railways Manju Gupta wrote to the Railways Board: “The Schedule of Powers, vide para 58 of Part-A (Powers of General Manager), empowers the GM/DRMs to requisition helicopter/aeroplane to reach the site of serious accident for rescue operations expeditiously and to evacuate injured and dead in the event of serious accident. No such powers for hiring/booking chartered flight/helicopter for Hon’ble MR (Minister of Railway) have been given therein.’’Newslaundry has accessed this letter. The letter also states that the Railways Board should put appropriate norms in place since “such demands [for charter flights] may arise’’ in future. The letter proposes that the Railways Board should depute a Railways Public Sector Unit (PSU) to hire charter planes if need be. After receiving the letter, the Railways Board without wasting any time appointed Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation (IRCTC) to hire charter planes for the Minister.Goyal, however, later dropped his Surat travel plan. It is unclear how the Railways Board could appoint the IRCTC to overrule a central government circular. Later, as per Railways records accessed by Newslaundry, IRCTC did book charter planes for Piyush on at least three occasions.Records show that Goyal first flew along with his wife Seema Goyal and his private secretary to Mumbai-Belgaum-Delhi on a three-day trip (February 9-11, 2018), which cost Rs 13 lakh. His second charter flight to Shani Shingnapur-Shirdi-Tulapur (pilgrimage places known for their temples) and later to Latur on April 2 cost Rs 25.50 lakh. This trip coincided with a bhoomi poojan of a coach factory he attended at Latur. And on June 2, he travelled from Delhi to Jodhpur and then back to Delhi on a charter plane, costing over Rs 10 lakh.Goyal’s charter plane seems to have incurred more expenses towards waiting rather than flying if one is to go by the three-day Belgaum schedule put out by his office. A charter plane takes anything between Rs 2 lakh and Rs 3 lakh per hour as waiting charge.According to the schedule, he arrived at Belgaum at 10:00 am on February 10. The charter plane remained parked till 8.15 pm on February 11, and then it took off to Delhi, his final destination. And when the plane was parked, the minister travelled by road to inspect a site of road over-bridge, paid tribute to Mahatma Gandhi at Belagavi railway station, inaugurated UTS Mobile ticketing App over South Western Railways Zone from Belagavi railway station and works to the facelift of the station building.Piyush Goyal also interacted with industrialists and members of Chamber of Commerce. The function went on for an hour to get members’ views on the forthcoming annual budget and Railways infrastructure.It would have cost Goyal less than Rs 50,000 if he had taken a routine return flight to Belgaum, assuming he was travelling by business class. But a charter plane cost taxpayers nearly Rs 13 lakh. The minister inaugurated a Railways App and discussed the budget with businessmen. Again, it should be remembered that the minister is not entitled to charter planes unless he is inspecting an accident site.During his charter flight to Latur in April, Goyal first went to pay homage to deities. “I’m fortunate to have darshan of Shani mandir in Shani Shingnapur this morning; I took blessings of Sai Baba at Shirdi and then went to Tuljapur to take blessings of Maa Bhawani before coming to Latur,’’ he was later quoted saying in his speech. Piyush did bhoomi pujan of a coach factory at Latur and wound up the tour. The chartered flight alone cost the exchequer Rs 25.50 lakh.Piyush and his family visited Shani Shingnapur in the past too. According to his website, he had visited Shani Shingnapur on October 26, 2016, along with his wife and son Dhruv.Moreover, one of his latest trips by a special plane was to Jodhpur, where he flagged off Humsafar Jodhpur-Bandra Express. This cost taxpayers a little over Rs 10 lakh.",1

570,"Railways, Urban Development Ministries To Redevelop Stations Under Smart City PlansIn a major initiative, railway stations and adjoining areas will be redeveloped on Smart City lines for enhancing passenger amenities, easy access to stations, enabling optimal utilization of land at railway stations, as a part of Smart City development. A Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was signed in this regard by the Ministries of Urban Development and Railways in the presence of Shri M.Venkaiah Naidu and Shri Suresh Prabhu. Dr.Sameer Sharma, Mission Director, Smart City Mission and Shri Rajiv Chaudhary, Advisor, Ministry of Railways signed the MoU. Both the Ministers lauded the joint initiative as a historic landmark that brings synergy in development of smart cities since there can’t be a smart city without a smart railway station. M.Venkaiah Naidu said on the occasion that this convergence based city development will result in qualitative improvement in city life. He suggested involvement of local people in redevelopment plans. Naidu suggested that to begin with 10 cities could be taken up for the proposed redevelopment with the involvement of National Buildings Construction Corporation(NBCC) which has successfully executed redevelopment projects on self-financing basis. These cities are : Sarai Rohilla (Delhi), Bhubaneswwar, Lucknow, Varnasi, Jaipur, Kota, Thane, Margao(Goa), Tirupati and Puducherry. This was agreed to by Railway Minister. Minister of Railways Suresh Prabhu said that railway stations have been the core of city development and have become congested over time and their redevelopment offers immense opportunities for changing city landscape. Stating that redevelopment work of Habibganj railway station has already been awarded and plans for Anand Vihar (Delhi), Surat, Bijwasan and Gandhinagar are in advanced stage. He said that several countries like Germany, France, Japan, South Korea, UK and Belgium have showed interest in redevelopment and a Round Table of domestic and overseas bankers will be organized next week to discuss financing of these redevelopment projects. To be implemented first in the 100 cities included in the Smart City Mission, redevelopment of railway stations will be undertaken in AMRUT (Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation) and HRIDAY (Heritage Infrastructure Development and Augmentation Yojana) cities extending the scope of the MoU to over 500 cities. Railway station and the adjoining area in each of these cities will be redeveloped on the lines of Area Based Development provided in the Smart City Mission Guidelines. Average cost of redevelopment of identified area of about 500 acres in the Smart City Plans of 60 cities approved so far comes to about Rs.1,500 cr. The proposed redevelopment involving railway stations envisages improving passenger amenities, easy access to stations, integrated public transport hub, waiting halls and other amenities for passengers, development of residential and commercial spaces, land scaping etc. The joint initiative of the Ministries of Urban Development and Railways widens the smart city development to one more area in each of the mission cities with each city required to select one area under respective Smart City Plans in the first phase. The MoU proposes two Joint Venture options for speedy redevelopment of railway station centred areas. The first being between the Railways and the Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) formed for execution of Smart City Plans, with equal share in equity. In the second model, National Buildings Construction Corporation (NBCC) can be roped in with equal share among the three. NBCC can design, develop and execute the redevelopment plans on self-financing basis. While the Ministry of Railways takes the responsibility of forming Joint Ventures, the Ministry of Urban Development will work with the States and Urban Local Bodies for integrating railway station redevelopment as part of smart city development plans. MoU states that ‘Both railway station redevelopment and Smart City concepts are part of holistic development of respective city. Redevelopment of railway station and its suburbs as part of Smart City Plans leads to an integrated public transport hub around railway station and encourage Transit Oriented Development.” The validity of the MoU is five years to begin with and can be extended with the consent of both the Ministries. Smart City Plans of some cities have already included area based development surrounding railway stations. These include; Bhubaneswar, Thane and Solapur (Maharashtra), Kakinada (Andhra Pradesh), Ahmedabad, Ajmer, Hubli-Dharwad (Karnataka). Smart City Plans of some other cities may potentially impact city railway station and allied services. These include; Jaipur, Kochi, Jabalpur, Visakhapatnam, Indore, Pune, Bhopal, Chennai etc.",0

Of the 54 consequential train accidents in 2017 (between April 1 and December 15), five were reported from ECR.Rescue and relief works in progress after the nine coaches of Delhi-bound Seemanchal Express derailed at Sahadai Buzurg station in Vaishali district, Hajipur on February 3.(PTI Photo)East Central Zone of the Indian Railways, where 11 coaches of the Seemanchal Express (Jogbani-Anand Vihar) derailed on Sunday, is notorious for accidents.In a safety review in December, it emerged as the second-worst zone (of the total 18) in terms of consequential train accidents followed by the Northern Railway. It recorded five such incidents between April 1, 2018 and December 15, 2018. Northern Railway reported eight such incidents during the period. The total number stood at 45.The Indian Railways has adopted a “Zero Accident” policy, and the number of passengers killed in various railway accidents was lowest in 2017-18 (57). But deaths caused by derailments make experts worried. The Railways categorises accidents the following categories: collision, derailment, mishaps at manned level crossings, mishaps at unmanned level crossings and fire.“Bulk of railways’ money goes to staff cost and fuel...there is little left for the maintenance. Derailment of a passenger train is a major embarrassment for the railways, and they must do track maintenance on priority. The zone where the accident has taken used to be called the sleeping division, as efforts to improve tracks were less. This accident is a symptom that tracks and coaching maintenance are faulty and need to be fixed,” said Sri Prakash, who retired as member (traffic) of the Indian Railways in 2009.The East Central Railway comprises Dhanbad, Mughal Sarai, Samastipur and Danapur divisions.

572,"Rain, hailstorm damage mustard, vegetable crops; wheat largely unaffectedWhile the rains will help cut the cost of irrigation for the wheat crop, these are set to affect the output of oilseeds.By Parshant Krar, ET Bureau |Feb 09, 2019, 09.11 PM ISTCHANDIGARH: Heavy rains and hailstorms that lashed north-western India on Thursday have caused damage to oilseeds and other easily perishable crops, mainly peas, potato and cauliflower, in the region. But the main rabi crop of wheat may have scraped through the inclement weather. While the rains will help cut the cost of irrigationNSE -1.73 % for the wheat crop, these are set to affect the output of oilseeds. “Mustard is affected by heavy rains as well as strong gust in several district ,” a senior official at the Haryana agriculture department said. Growers of peas, potato and cauliflower have suffered heavy losses as their crops are affected by the hailstorm. While mustard has taken a hit in Haryana, the weather has damaged the potato crop in Punjab. Wheat is expected to gain from the precipitation, though there could be a marginal yield loss in hailstorm-affected areas. As the wheat crop has not attained height, the wind and rain have not affected it,” an official of Punjab’s agriculture department said, adding: “But hailstorm has affected all the crops.” Officials, however, have alerted farmers about the risk of yellow rust that dwells in wet weather. Hailstorm and strong winds have caused damage in several pockets in districts of Sirsa, Hisar, Mahendergarh, Palwal, Bhiwani Kaithal and Gurgaon in Haryana. The Haryana government has decided to conduct survey of damage to crops In Punjab, initial reports indicate crop losses in Patiala, Ludhiana, Fatehgarh Sahib, Hoshiarpur, Mohali and Ferozepur. “There are preliminary reports of damage to crops, mainly perishables, but it will take a few days for the assessment of the extent of loss,” Punjab’s principal secretary of agriculture, KS Pannu, said.

576,"Rice Exports to gather steam on US, West Asia demand boostRice exports from India are set to swing in the last quarter of this year on a spate in orders after shipments slumped 14% in the last three quarters over high input costs and tepid demand from Bangladesh.By Parshant KrarChandigarh: Rice exports from India are set to swing in the last quarter of this year on a spate in orders after shipments slumped 14% in the last three quarters over high input costs and tepid demand from Bangladesh. “Consignments in January are better than the previous year and the trade is likely to attain levels close to the previous year,” a senior commerce and industry ministry official told ET. Exporters have seen a surge in demand from the United Arab Emirates, Iran, Saudi Arabia and the US this quarter. The official said the supply for exports has streamlined after being affected for the last few months of 2018 because of assembly polls in some states. A bumper yield in Bangladesh also took toll on Indian exports, he said. The 5% subsidy on export value extended to non-basmati rice under the Merchandise Exports from India Scheme (MEIS) in November helped in recovery of trade , but margins remained thin, exporters said. “Raw material (paddy) prices are still high as most farmers are inclined to sell to the state agencies in states, including Chhattisgarh,” said P Baskara Reddy, promoter of Kakinada-based Sri Chitra Agri Exports. He said the exporters hope that the scheme will be extended beyond March 26 and the incentive doubled to 10% under MEIS to complement the shrinking margins. The announcement of higher price assistance by political parties just ahead of the harvesting season in the run-up to the assembly polls had spiked government procurement and dampened private purchase in states like Chhattisgarh where the procurement price was higher by 60%. The non-basmati rice exports that are dependent largely on varieties grown in Chhattisgarh were affected as paddy supply dried up following announcement of higher than minimum support price (MSP). Exporters are wary of such politically motivated price assistance. “Higher procurement price will subdue trade in the coming years. Direct financial assistance is a better route to support farmers,” Rice Exporters’ Association president BV Krishan Rao said. Higher procurement would lead to a surplus buffer stock and a situation where the government will have to auction its stocks at a loss, he said. “Similar situation took place in 1999-2000 when Food Corporation of India had to release its brimming stocks at a discount after higher MSP had boosted federal procurement three-times over the buffer stock norms,” Rao said. The rice procurement crossed 41 lakh tonnes so far compared to 32.5 lakh tonnes in Chhattisgarh in the last Kharif marketing season. “We have not taken export commitments this season as farmers are keen to sell to government agencies,” a senior executive of Uttar Pradesh-based Laxmi Rice Mills said. While export of basmati rice has increased till December, non-basmati exports stayed downhill with 5.6 million tonnes of shipment till December as against 6.3 MT a year ago.",0

The two pilots, Squadron Leader Samir Abrol and Squadron Leader Siddhartha Negi, died on the spot.The arresters installed at HAL airport are expected to stop aircraft that weigh up to 30 tonnes travelling at speeds of up to 160-170 knots. The Mirage 2000 trainer weighs much less, 13-14 tonnes, and was travelling at a speed of less than 160 knots, the officials added.Abrol and Negi were on an “acceptance sortie” of the Mirage 2000 trainer aircraft after it was overhauled by the Bengaluru-based, state-owned company. The sortie was taking place on the HAL runway in Yemalur in Bengaluru on February 1.An HAL spokesperson declined comment. An Indian Air Force (IAF) spokesperson, too, declined comment because of the ongoing court of inquiry into the accident.Read more| ‘My son loved to fly Mirage 2000’, says father of IAF officer killed in crash in BengaluruThe accident occurred a day after IAF chief Air Chief Marshal BS Dhanoa criticised HAL, and also pointed to the number of pilots who lost their lives testing the state-owned firm’s indigenously developed aircraft.According to the officials, the number of times major snags have been detected by IAF at the time of delivery in an aircraft overhauled or manufactured by HAL is high. For instance, last June, an Su-30 was on an acceptance sortie (its 13th) when it crashed near Nashik. The pilot and the flight engineer ejected successfully. These sorties are done by IAF only after HAL has flown the aircraft a certain number of times and cleared them for acceptance.In 2018-2019, the Russian designed Su-30Mki – the mainstay fighter of the IAF – manufactured by HAL required as many as six sorties as against the designated two sorties before they could be accepted. “The increased number of sorties is because snags were found,” a second senior government official said.Read more | Outdated jets for IAF, cheese & wine for babus: Pilot’s brother pens poemSimilarly, Mirage 2000 aircraft overhauled by HAL have, on average, required two sorties more than the mandatory number because of snags. And, Jaguars, the British made deep-strike bombers that are overhauled by HAL, have required, on average, three sorties more than the two sorties designated for acceptance. For the advanced light helicopters (ALH), flown by the Indian Army, Navy and Air Force, and also made by HAL, the numbers are equally bad.“Every aircraft needs to go through a certain number of sorties testing various test points before it can be accepted by IAF for deployment. The fact that the more sorties are having to be flown to rectify the snags indicates either the process of testing is not being done properly by the manufacturer or the process lacks rigorousness at the HAL end,” said Air Marshal SBP Sinha (retd), who till recently was the Air Officer Commanding at the Central Air Command of IAF.Arrester barriers are installed at the end of the runway to deal with exactly the kind of situation the overhauled Mirage 2000 trainer was facing. They are meant to stop an aircraft that has either aborted take-off or made an emergency landing from overshooting the runway with minimal damage to aircraft or injury to the crew.In this case, the Mirage 2000 trainer came down seconds after take-off. The undercarriage of the aircraft was sheared off, most likely because of the impact. And the arrester barrier was the only way that the two test pilots could have brought the aircraft to a stop.The black box of the fighter has been sent to France for a detailed analysis to assist the Court of Inquiry (CoI) that is investigating the crash. “Separately, inquiries are also being conducted on why the arrester barrier gave way,” said a senior HAL official who asked not to be named.",0

579,"Scrap free pass for rail employees’Railway activists on Sunday demanded that perks like free suburban passes for railway employees as well as their families be taken away from both Central and Western railway employees, to save more time and money.They were reacting to the Central Railway’s proposal of limiting the validity of return tickets to six hours. Subhash Gupta from Rail Pravasi Sangh and also a member of CR’s Divisional Railway Users Consultative Committee (DRUCC) said, “Officials said that the idea was proposed to save time and, on the other hand, the railway employees are issued passes that can be used for unlimited number of journeys for free.”A railway official revealed on the condition of anonymity that around 3.5 lakh railway employees and family members avail of this facility in Central Railway’s (CR) head office at CST and Western Railway’s (WR) at Mumbai Central.“The railway passes is resulting in a loss of approximately Rs 7 to Rs 7.5 crore yearly as a result of this facility to its employees,” said the official.The passes include both second and first class but most of the passes get issued for first class,” he further added.Mr Gupta said the railway city officials should discuss the proposal and the passes with the unions.“It is in common knowledge that free passes are not given to not only to the employees but also to the immediate family and it is a burden that the Mumbai railway can no longer bear” he said.“The railway employees should at least get together with the union and discuss the issue,” he further added.",1
580,"Send a message: Pakistan’s weakest pressure points are financial rather than militaryIndia can work with the US, EU and other major powers to impose tough sanctions on Pakistan’s military-ISI elite which drives its security policies and much else in the country.TNN|Feb 25, 2019, 11.16 AM ISTFollowing the Pulwama terror attack Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan claimed he needed “actionable intelligence” on Jaish-e-Muhammed’s (JeM) role, despite the terror outfit itself claiming responsibility for the attack. Since then, the Pakistani Punjab government has moved to take control of the seminaries in Bahawalpur, thought to be JeM’s headquarters. But information minister Fawad Chaudhry claiming these are purely religious madrasas, with no connection to JeM, showed Islamabad up to its usual game of making token gestures whenever international heat is cranked up on it. It does indicate an area of vulnerability, though, which is worth building upon if New Delhi is to inflict a high cost on Pakistan for harbouring terror safe havens. Military strikes are difficult at this point since the element of surprise is gone; moreover terror facilities such as Bahawalpur are likely to have been evacuated by now. But Pakistan is short of foreign currency; indeed its policy of nurturing terror creates chronic internal instability which prevents it from having a viable usual game of making token gestures whenever international heat is cranked up on it. Giving proof to Pakistan on terror activities from its soil has been proven to be pointless by now, but lobbying international agencies has had some success. The UN Security Council has, for the first time, condemned a terror strike in Kashmir and blamed JeM for it. New Delhi must strongly lobby international financial agencies such as IMF or FATF to blacklist Pakistan and deny it financial bailouts, till such time as it can roll up its terror infrastructure. This also serves US interests, as it can roll up its terror infrastructure. This also serves US interests, as it would like to see a stable Afghanistan when it leaves. New Delhi and Washington should work closely together on this. India can, in addition, work with the US, EU and other major powers to impose tough sanctions on Pakistan’s military-ISI elite which drives its security policies and much else in the country. Such sanctions would quickly bring Pakistan around, and the argument for them can be reinforced by putting the international community on notice that further terror outrages such as 26/11 or Pulwama will lead to an automatic military response from India, as India has the right to defend itself and domestic public opinion will not stand for anything less.",0

All the seven persons — four men, two women and an eight-year-old girl — died on the spot. Six of the deceased were in the ambulance while one was travelling in the car, police said.“The ambulance was going from Jammu to Patna and carrying the body of one Zakir Ansari. The driver, Hari Singh from Jammu, was killed in the accident,” said SP Sharma, in-charge of Baldeo police station in Mathura.Police have been able to identify five of the deceased. These included Jehangir Alam 36, Mohd Tahir Ansari, 32, Suhail Ahmad, 30, and ambulance driver Hari Singh, police said.“Those in the car on the other side of divider were from Tundla town in Firozabad.

582,"Smriti Irani in Amethi ahead of PM’s visit, accuses Rahul Gandhi of lyingAhead of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to Amethi on March 3, union textile minister Smriti Irani on Sunday reached the Congress bastion to launch a scathing attack on local MP and Congress president Rahul Gandhi.Her Amethi visit was timed with the launch of the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN) Scheme by the PM in Gorakhpur on Sunday.Distributing Kisan Samman Nidhi certificates to 25 farmers from Amethi in a symbolic launch of cash transfer scheme during a programme at Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya in Gauriganj, Irani repeatedly accused Gandhi of “lying”.Hailing the PM-KISAN Scheme, she said it would benefit 3.80 lakh farmers of Amethi alone. Modi had last visited Amethi on the final day of the 2014 Lok Sabha poll campaign, a visit which political experts believe helped Irani put up an impressive fight against Gandhi in just about 20 days.She had brought down Gandhi’s victory margin to one lakh votes in 2014, down from 3 lakh in 2009. Irani is widely tipped to re-contest against Congress chief Rahul Gandhi in the 2019 LS polls.“Five years back, Narendra Modiji had promised development. He has honoured his promise even as Amethi’s ‘naamdaar’ family only sold dreams to you,” she said after listening to Modi’s radio show ‘Mann ki Baat’.Accusing Gandhi of never raising the issue of “Amethi’s development” in Lok Sabha, she said: “Your local MP never cared about the development of Amethi but about 1.40 lakh people in Amethi benefited through Modi government’s Ujjawala scheme and another 1.25 lakh got the benefits of Ayushman Bharat Scheme which provides illness cover of up to Rs 5 lakh per annum to each poor household.”“The Modi government gave you ‘izzat ghar’ (toilets). In record time, the Yogi Adityanath government in UP has identified poor farmers who would benefit under the Kisan Samman Nidhi,” she said, stressing that only the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) could develop Amethi.She said the Modi government honoured 12 farmers with Padma awards.Irani inspected the venue where the PM would address the people of Amethi and also met BJP leaders who have been tasked with ensuring a good turnout for Modi’s rally.Both the Samajwadi Party (SP) and the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) have decided against fielding a candidate from Amethi and Rae Bareli in 2019 LS polls – a decision likely to benefit the Congress.",0

584,"Spontaneous rail roko hits Central RailwayA technical snag at the level crossing at Bhivpuri railway station triggered commuter unrest at Badlapur Friday early morning.Hundreds of angry commuters gathered on platforms and railway tracks to stage a “rail roko” for nearly six hours, from 5.05 am till such time the protest was called off after a written assurance from the stationmaster. Meanwhile, Amitabh Ojha, divisional railway manager (DRM), held commuters responsible and said he would find out the anti-social elements responsible for fanning the agitation. A CST-bound local got delayed owing to signal failure at Bhivpuri which sparked off the protest. What started as an argument between commuters and the stationmaster turned into a full-blown rail roko. “At first, there were only four railway police present at the station but when commuters stepped in front of the train to stop it and did not budge for half-an-hour, we deployed around 160 personnel on an emergency basis. We were afraid it would escalate into a Diva-like situation,” said an official on condition of anonymity. Initially, a handful of commuters started protesting irregular rail services on Central Railway (CR) but soon, hundreds of commuters, who face the same plight every day, joined in.Passengers stopped all trains plying into and out of the station and shouted slogans against CR. They were in no mood to listen to the railway police or commuters’ association or pravasi sanghatana. Finally, railway minister Suresh Prabhu had to intervene and request commuters to end their agitation.Following Mr Prabhu’s tweet, Mr Ojha reached Badlapur around 10 am and held a meeting with railway officials and the railway police. City police too attended the meeting. The police then tried to get commuters off the railway tracks but in vain. At about 10.40 am, the stationmaster assured commuters that local trains would run on time and would not be delayed. He urged them to stop agitating and allow trains to move.Only after a written assurance from him did commuters call off the protest, and the first train of the day which had been stopped at Badlapur since 5.05 am, started its journey at 10.52 am.By end of the day, CR saw more than 50 services cancelled and more than 65 trains delayed. ""We are expecting even bigger numbers by end of the day. The Kalyan-Thane section had no trains, and we began to run special trains between Ambernath and CSTM/Kalyan, Vangani and Karjat, and Khopoli,"" said another official on condition of anonymity.After train services resumed, Mr Ojha, while speaking with media persons, said that some anti-social elements were behind the protest. ""We are trying to find the people who started the protest at the railway station early morning. We suspect they were not regular commuters but probably some anti-social elements and we will trace them,"" he said. However, no complaint against unknown persons was filed with the railway police till evening.Advocate R.S. Godbole, adviser to pravasi sanghatana, said that the population of Badlapur had increased over the past five years as most people from Mumbai had shifted to Badlapur owing to low-cost housing and clean atmosphere. However, CR had not increased its services proportionately.""There's always a heavy rush of Pune-bound commuters. We need a third and fourth dedicated lane for express trains from Kalyan to Karjat. But the railway board has ignored our demands. Friday's incident is nothing but commuters' pent-up anger that finally exploded. If the issues are not sorted out, what happened at Diva could well be repeated at Badlapur,"" warned Advocate Godbole.Meanwhile, with over 21 local train ferries affected since morning and trains running from CST to Ambernath, most commuters travelled to Ambernath by taking an auto-rickshaw from Badlapur station.Sensing an opportunity, rickshaw-wallahs charged passengers Rs 200 instead of the usual Rs 20 for the Badlapur-Ambernath commute. Kalyan Dombivali Municipal Transport provided five city buses for the Kalyan-Badlapur ferry.",1

The announcement comes just ahead of the Lok Sabha poll dates being declared. As part of the agreement, the Railway Board will give 650 acres of its land at Re 1 per acre, and in turn, the Karnataka government will bear partial costs of doubling two lines, estimated to cost Rs 1,700 crore.In a joint press conference alongside Kumaraswamy, Goyal said the long-awaited rail network connecting 82 stations spread over 160 km costing Rs 23,000 crore will be completed in six years.Goyal said, “The ‘19’ conditions subject to which ‘in principle’ approval was given by Karnataka state cabinet will be ratified, as mutually agreed during the meeting today.”The CM also assured, “In next cabinet meeting of Government of Karnataka scheduled to be held on February 25, cabinet resolution will be passed on the same. GO to that extent will be communicated to Ministry of Railways for further taking up the project.”A statement from the Indian Railways further stated, “Minister of Railways agreed for granting railway land for the project at very nominal lease basis of Re.1 per acre, which will reduce the cost of project by about Rs.6700 crores, nearly by 30 %. Government of Karnataka agreed for unequivocal right of FSI ‘5’ on railway land to Indian Railway for financing of project.Government of Karnataka will approve the entire corridor without any curtailment. It is also agreed by Government of Karnataka will do cost sharing of two doubling projects Baiyyappanahalli-Hosur, Yesvantpur-Banaswadi-Hosur which was initially agreed and later disagreed upon by State Government.”As part of this project, the Kempegowda International Airport will also be connected to the city via the suburban rail system. Out of the 83 stations, 12 including Majestic will have intermodal connectivity with the Bengaluru Metro. The announcement comes after days of disagreement between the state and Centre over the cost sharing of the project. The Ministry of Railways had also expressed surprise at Karnataka increasing the length of the rail project to 360 km without prior intimation.The announcement was awaited as the Karnataka Chief Minister gave an in-principal nod to the project based on a  pre-feasibility report readied by the Rail India Technical and Economic Service (RITES) in January.",1

The seer was heading to Haridwar from Prayagraj (Allahabad). The driver is said to have slept while driving the SUV, which crashed into the truck ahead.UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath and BJP president Amit Shah condoled the demise of Hansdevacharya, who was the leader of the Bairagis campaigning for construction of a Ram temple in Ayodhya at the site where Babri Masjid existed.The mosque was demolished in December 1992 by karsevaks (volunteers) who had gathered in the UP town following a call given by Vishwa Hindu Parishad and supported by the Bharatiya Janata Party to push for construction of a Ram temple there. The VHP and the BJP have maintained that it was the place where Lord Ram was born.The Supreme Court is hearing the title suit in the matter after a judgment of the Allahabad High Court was challenged before it.

591,"Tragedies are becoming far too commonThe Indian Air Force can begin addressing the problem by being more transparent and releasing periodic reports on accidents and their causes.A still from a video footage shows an aircraft in flames after two aircrafts of IAF's aerobatic team Surya Kiran crashed near the Yelahanka airbase in Bengaluru, Feb 19, 2019(PTI)During the rehearsal for the Aero India show currently underway, two Hawk Mk 132 aircrafts collided resulting in the death of one pilot. The tragic news comes close on the heels of a Mirage 2000 crash on February 1, which led to loss of two pilots. A Jaguar crashed on January 28 and a Mig-27 crashed on February 12, thankfully without any loss of lives.The problem of crashes is not new for the Indian Air Force (IAF). The year 2018 saw a number of crashes involving Sukhoi, Jaguar and MIG planes. In fact, the number of accidents that IAF has had with MIGs — 482 in 40 years till 2012 — had earned the aircraft the dubious title of “flying coffin”. The infamy was immortalised in the iconic film Rang De Basanti in 2006.Why are IAF planes so accident prone? One, it is simply the problem of slow movement on defence modernisation. IAF is flush with ageing planes on their last legs. Chief Justice of India Ranjan Gogoi recently dismissed a plea asking for judicial enquiry into the February 1 Mirage crash claiming that the aircraft was very old and “bound to crash”.Two, IAF is known to make its pilots undergo intense and rigorous training. Such a practice puts immense strain on the limited number of aircraft, pilots and the support staff. Three, tardy maintenance and upgrade of some of these planes has also been an issue. IAF puts the blame on HAL, which indeed is running way behind the schedule on a number of projects including the Mirage 2000 upgrade.Four, IAF has to operate in harsh tropical weather which is quite demanding on its planes. Then there are problems such as bird strikes, which, some estimates suggest, are responsible for 10% of accidents. It should be noted that the government scrapped a Rs 250 crore tender for buying bird detection and monitoring radars in 2015.Perhaps, IAF can begin addressing the problem by being more transparent. An annual, or even a triennial, report on accidents and their causes would be a good way to start. Some individual cases may be embarrassing to the service, but an aggregate release of data would do much good simply by shining the light on deficiencies — and ensure that more of its brave pilots do not become casualties.",0
592,"Transformation of railways in NDA budgets Prime Minister Narendra Modi had promised to transform the railways before coming to power, and he has been on track. Though there's still a lot to be done, the railways have managed to shed the image of a state enterprise impervious to change and aloof to its customers' needs. A large number of new customer services has made the railways more customer-oriented while launch of faster trains and significant upgrades of existing ones have changed the look of the railways. In Railway Budget 2014, then railway minister Sadananda Gowda pitched for reforms by proposing private and foreign direct investment and public-private partnership to meet the resource crunch. He proposed the highest-ever plan outlay of Rs 65,445 crore. He also announced plans for introduction of a bullet train in Mumbai-Ahmedabad sector. ""We need huge investment for running bullet train. There was a ban on FDI in railways. Now we would request commerce ministry to delete that clause so that thethere can be FDI in infrastructure development,"" he said. At that time, the announcement did not excite many, but the ambitious project did begin within a few years with a loan from Japan. In Railway Budget 2015-16, the new minister Suresh Prabhu kept fares unchanged and eschewed populist gestures such as new trains and stations in his maiden budget, He preferring to bring a technocrat's focus to try and improve amenities for customers, set the organisation's trajectory for the next five years and put its derailed finances back on tracks. In a historic move, the government merged the railway budget with the general budget in 2017, ending a 92-year-old practice of a separate budget for the country’s largest transporter. The total proposed outlay for 2017-18 was Rs 1,31,000 crore, an 8 per cent increase from the 2016-17 budget. Finance Minister Arun Jaitley announced that a Rail Safety Fund will be created over a period of five years with a corpus of Rs 100,000 crore. He also announced that 500 stations would be made differentlyabled-friendly by providing lifts and escalators. He promised a new Metro Rail Policy with focus on innovative models of implementation and financing, and standardisation and indigenisation of hardware and software. Budget 2018-19 gave a big boost to railways with a capital expenditure of Rs 1.48 lakh crore. ""Most of this money will be spent on capacity expansion, since it is a priority for the national transporter,"" Jaitley said. He proposed a target of doubling 18,000 km of lines and said gauge conversion was underway to eliminate capacity constraints. The minister said 36,000 km of rail track renewal had been targeted in the coming year while 4,267 unmanned railway crossings on broad gauge routes were to be eliminated in the next two years ",1
593,"Trauma care key to cut accident deathsDelhi reported the highest number of fatal road crashes during 2017 with 1,584 deaths, according to the latest available data from the ministry of road transport and highways. In the same year, 6,673 accidents were reported from the city.The AIIMS trauma centre, one of the two level 1 trauma centres in Delhi, receives around 200 to 250 cases daily, the highest in the city. Of these, over 70% are victims of road crash.(Picture for representation)Delhi reported the highest number of fatal road crashes during 2017 with 1,584 deaths, according to the latest available data from the ministry of road transport and highways. In the same year, 6,673 accidents were reported from the city.“The number of traffic deaths in Delhi is high because of the high number of road accidents. And, the infrastructure and the enforcement of traffic rules, along with the pre-hospital care systems, are to blame,” said Dr Sanjeev Bhoi, professor of emergency medicine at Jai Prakash Narayan Apex Trauma Centre, All India Institute of Medical Sciences.The AIIMS trauma centre, one of the two level 1 trauma centres in Delhi, receives around 200 to 250 cases daily, the highest in the city. Of these, over 70% are victims of road crash.And, the numbers might be under-reported.“These numbers are gathered from the police cases registered and are likely to be under-reported. Sometimes patients die days after the case is registered and this may not get updated in the records,” said Dr Rakhi Dandona, who heads the Global Burden of Disease –Road Injuries group for the State-level Disease Burden initiative.At country level, the World Health Organisation’s Global Status Report on Road Safety 2018 estimated the number of traffic deaths to be 2,99,091 in 2016, which is nearly double the 1,50, 785 deaths reported in that year.Injuries to be wary ofMost accident victims suffer from poly-trauma — injuries to more than one system of the body. But it is the head injury that leads to the highest mortality and disability.“Of all the accident cases, almost 40% come in with severe head injuries. And, in such cases, even if the patient reaches hospital on time and receives the best care, 35% die within 48 hours.Of those that survive, half are left in a vegetative state and the rest experience some sort of cognitive deficit depending on what part of the brain is affected. No one is left unscathed. Wearing a simple helmet can reduce the number of head injuries,” Dr Bhoi said.Apart from head trauma, the second most fatal is excessive bleeding. “Around 30% accident victims come in a haemorrhagic shock caused by excessive bleeding. This can be prevented by using a tourniquet. Tying a piece of cloth tightly above the area that is bleeding can reduce the blood flow,” Dr Bhoi said.How to reduce mortalityThe best way to reduce mortality is to reduce the number of accidents, the experts say. For this, there is a need to plan cities better and to improve road infrastructure.“The first step is to ensure that there are no potholes, and there are appropriate speed breakers and signage. And, the authorities should be on the lookout for and fix black spots or areas where a lot of accidents are reported. The pavements need to be improved and the roads have to be made keeping in mind the pedestrians,” said Dr Nutan Mehta, head of the new emergency and trauma wing of Dr Ram Manohar Lohia hospital.Then comes following speed limits taking safety measures such as wearing helmets and putting on seat belts.A study at the AIIMS trauma centre found that only half of the two-wheeler users were wearing helmets, only 45% had fastened it properly, and only 38.5% were wearing a helmet approved as “crash proof” by the Bureau of Indian Standards.Only 32.4% people used seat belts, showed another study from AIIMS. This is because of lax enforcement, which is the key to ensure safe driving practices.“World over, there is enough evidence to suggest that awareness alone cannot ensure safe driving practices. There is a need for strict enforcement so that people face real consequences like licences being cancelled and actually not being able to drive after the licence is cancelled. But, we do not have enough manpower to ensure that all violators get punished,” Dr Dandona said.Poor vehicular standards are also to blame. “Most of the commonly used cars in India do not adhere to the international safety standards. The New Car Assessment Programme (NCAP), which looks at how likely a driver or passenger is of surviving a crash, shows that there are only two or three cars that have a four-star rating, a norm strictly followed in the West,” Dr Bhoi said. And, even if there is a crash, to ensure that a person survives there is a need for a strong pre-hospital and hospital care.“Currently, there aren’t enough trauma care hospitals in the country, which means valuable time is lost and the patient does not get appropriate care within the first “golden” hour of the crash when the chances of survival and minimum disability is the highest. The roads are such that it is also difficult for ambulance to reach an accident site and then take the patient to the hospital in time,” said Dr Dandona.People at riskPeople walking on the roads and those driving two-wheelers have the highest risk of severe injury in road crashes. In India, 40% of all road crash deaths were reported in motorised two and three-wheeler riders and 10% in pedestrians.“In India as in any developing countries, higher number of injuries and deaths are reported in two wheeler riders and pedestrians because of the traffic mix. We have high speed cars moving along with bikes, cycles and pedestrians on the roads. This is because missing or occupied pavements and cycles lanes and the attitude of the people as well,” Dr Dandona said.Also, men outnumber women when it comes to road crashes.A study of demographics of the victims of road crash in Delhi showed that 84% were men and just 16% were women. Besides, almost 50% of the victims belonged to the 16-30 age group.“These are the groups that are more likely to travel for work. The way we have developed the infrastructure of the city, people have to travel long distances to get to work. There are commercial hubs and residential hubs in Delhi. Ideally, people should be working in their neighbourhood. If that were the case, 90% of the people would be off roads in the city,” said Dr Mehta of RML hospital.People in a hurry also lead to a higher number of crashes. Of the 900 accident victims interviewed for a 2017 study, 54.2% reported that they were in a hurry to reach somewhere. The same study reported that 26.1% were having a conversation with co-rider or on a cell phone. Drivers using mobile phones are 4 times more likely to be involved in a crash, according to the World Health Organisation.",0

The IAF is now left with 48 Mirage 2000 fighters.Smoke billows from the wreckage of a Mirage 2000 aircraft which crashed in Bengaluru Friday morning.(ANI)Two pilots of the Indian Air Force (IAF) were killed on Friday after their Mirage 2000 fighter jet crashed during takeoff at the Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) airport here.The French-origin trainer aircraft, manufactured by Dassault Aviation, was on an acceptance sortie after being upgraded at HAL, an IAF spokesperson said in New Delhi. IAF has ordered a probe into the accident that comes four days after a Jaguar aircraft went down in Kushinagar, Uttar Pradesh.First inducted into IAF in 1984, Friday’s crash was the 11th accident involving the Mirage 2000 fleet. The IAF is now left with 48 Mirage 2000 fighters.HAL identified the two pilots as squadron leaders Samir Abrol and Siddartha Negi.Commissioned into IAF in June 2008, Abrol, 33, was from Ghaziabad. Negi, 31, hailed from Dehradun and joined IAF in June 2009.“HAL regrets to inform that one upgraded Mirage 2000 aircraft crashed during the customer acceptance flight at HAL airport here today [Friday] around 10.30 am,” the state-owned plane maker said in a statement.Officials said that the pilots had ejected from the plane but landed on its wreckage.Minutes after the crash, residents from nearby areas posted videos and images of the accident site on social media. The flight data recorder has been recovered from the site.India had in 2011 signed a $2.4-billion contract with Dassault Aviation and Thales to upgrade 51 Mirage 2000 fighters with new weapons, radars and avionics. The first two aircraft were upgraded by the firms in France followed by another two at HAL in Bengaluru. HAL is upgrading the remaining planes.The fighter that crashed was upgraded at HAL, said an official who did not want to be identified.The crash couldn’t have come at a worse time for HAL, as questions have been raised about the capabilities of the state-owned company that is going through financial trouble.Several HAL projects are running years behind schedule, including the Mirage 2000 upgrade programme, much to IAF’s dismay.The Mirage 2000 upgrade is five years behind schedule.IAF’s efforts to support HAL have affected its fighting capabilities, air force chief Air Chief Marshal BS Dhanoa said on Thursday. Speaking at a conference at the Centre for Air Power Studies in New Delhi, he was responding to criticism about IAF’s alleged dislike for the HAL-made Tejas light combat aircraft.Since Independence, 17 test pilots and engineers have lost their lives in air accidents during the testing and evaluation of indigenous planes such as Marut, Kiran, Ajeet, Saras and AWACS (airborne warning and control systems) prototype aircraft.",0

597,"Two striking examples of BMC inefficiency in 1 dayThis week, the newly restored Flora Fountain developed a leak within a couple of days of its inauguration and a short distance away large chunk of Marine Drive caved inThis week, Mumbai woke up to two fine examples of how well the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) runs the city. The newly restored fountain at Hutatma Chowk developed a leak within a couple of days of its inauguration. And a short distance away, a fairly large chunk of Marine Drive, Mumbai’s most famous and iconic promenade, caved in near the crossing where this road turns towards Churchgate station.The general understanding in Mumbai is that no matter what happens elsewhere, Marine Drive is among those areas — Malabar Hill, Breach Candy, Peddar Road, Carmichael Road, Altamount Road, Napean Sea Road being some others — that are very well looked after.The crème de la crème of Mumbai resides in these areas as well as the most powerful, among them leading politicians, bureaucrats, BMC officials and police chiefs. Maintaining these areas hassle-free is not a new development. It has been so historically.Among these, Marine Drive enjoys prime of place. This is the road that gives the city so much of its aesthetic beauty, glamour and character, starting from the outer edge of Girgaum Chowpatty and leading up to the southern end where the Gateway of India stands, taking in its sweep Nariman Point and Mantralaya, where the state’s seat of power is located.How could anything go wrong on this road one might ask? Well, what excellent evidence to the contrary. Or perhaps this is democracy at work, where every area is treated equally badly!And as for Flora Fountain’s short-lived rejuvenation, it makes it easier to understand why we have pipes that don’t take water where most badly needed and waste it elsewhere.If these mishaps were not so serious, it would be almost comical. That this should happen in the country’s leading city, in prime locations and both of them so close to the BMC headquarters, is the deep irony. What hope then for other, less prominent areas?The Marine Drive cave-in was fortunately anticipated in the nick of time, preventing accidents and casualties. What if one or a couple of cars were travelling over the part where the road caved in, it could have led to a monumental tragedy.Flora Fountain’s malfunction was not a threat to life, but was a setback nonetheless and stymied months of effort at reviving one of the city’s major landmarks.It becomes particularly galling when you consider that the BMC is the richest civic body in the country. Its annual budget is in excess of ?27,000 crore, so resources for development, maintenance and repairs can hardly be the issue.Why then should such things occur — or recur — considering that there had been a cave-in on Marine Drive a few years earlier too?The problem lies in the lack of proper planning and detailing of such work that is undertaken – as seems to be the case in the Marine Drive road collapse, as well as callous disregard for completing the ‘last mile’ diligently, as the Flora Fountain setback highlights.Authorities associated with both these projects have been at pains to highlight what has gone wrong. But their explanations don’t wash because all these should have been factored in, leaving zero scope for the trouble that has been witnessed.Accidents can happen and always come unannounced. It is the preparedness for such eventualities that matters.This is where the civic body has been utterly incompetent, for there have been several instances in the past where this has showed up.A diatribe against the BMC, however, is not the purpose of this column, nor is that of much help. A great deal has already been written about the efficiency or otherwise of the corporation. More words will be wasted.Whether the corporation will wake up now, after the recent problems is moot.The more pertinent question is whether citizens will wake up, say enough is enough, and demand stringent accountability.",0
598,"Two, 3-wheeler riders worst hit: WHOThe actual number of deaths, however, could be higher as per the report, which estimates that there were 2.99 lakh traffic fatalities. This means, an estimated 22.6 people per 100,000 population died of traffic accidents in India in 2016.Two and three-wheeler riders accounted for 40% of all traffic deaths in India in 2016, according to WHO’s Global Status Report on Road Safety 2018, which puts the total traffic deaths at 1.5 lakh that year.The actual number of deaths, however, could be higher as per the report, which estimates that there were 2.99 lakh traffic fatalities. This means, an estimated 22.6 people per 100,000 population died of traffic accidents in India in 2016.“The highest number of casualties are reported among people on two and three wheelers, and let me add pedestrians, because they do not have a protective exterior exposing them to more injuries. Also, the kind of speed and traffic mix in India means that cars with higher speed limits drive on the same road with two-wheelers with lower speed limit, making them more accident prone,” said Dr Rakhi Dandona who heads the Global Burden of Disease –Road Injuries group for the State-level Disease Burden initiative.Globally, 1.35 million people died in traffic crashes the same year.“The report shows that progress has been achieved in important areas such as legislation, vehicle standards and improving access to post-crash care. This progress has not, however, occurred at a pace fast enough. At this rate, the Sustainable Development Goal to halve road traffic deaths by 2020 will not be met,” the report stated.The estimated number of traffic fatalities is almost double, according to the World Health Organisation Report, which puts the absolute number of deaths at 2.99 lakhs. In 2016, 22.6 people in every 100,000 population died in traffic crashes.After two and three-wheeler, the highest number of deaths were reported in passengers of cars (12%), drivers and passengers of heavy trucks (11%), and pedestrians (10%) after deaths in two and three wheeler drivers.Looking at the factors leading to fatalities, the report found that India meets “two to six” international vehicle safety standards. The limit on blood alcohol concentration as per the law in India is 0.03 g/dl. Reducing blood alcohol concentrations from 0.1 g/dl to 0.05 g/dl may contribute to reduction in alcohol related road traffic fatalities by 6 - 18%, the report states.However, the maximum speed limit on urban and rural roads in India is 100 kmph. This is much higher than the speed of 50 kmph or less the report was looking at. “A 5% reduction in speed can reduce the number of fatalities by 30%,” it said.“There is a need to take a multi-sectoral approach to tackle road crashes and deaths. There has to better infrastructure that allows for safer travel, better vehicles, improved intervention and enforcement of laws, and a health system that can take care of accident victims. We need to look at the problem from a health perspective. Why should it be under the ministry of road transport and highways?” said Dr Dandona.India is the fourth-largest vehicle producer in the world.",0
599,"Two-year-old survives Audi-dumper crash in Delhi that killed his parents, grandmotherThree members of the Singhal family - Sumit Singhal, his wife Ruchi and his mother - were killed when a dumper truck overturned on their Audi car in in outer Delhi’s Rohini in the early hours of Wednesday.Passers-by look at the mangled remains of an Audi car which collided with a dumper at Rohini, in New Delhi, Wednesday, Feb. 20, 2019, killing three of the four occupants of the car. (PTI)When Sonu saw a dumper truck topple on top of an Audi in outer Delhi’s Rohini in the early hours of Wednesday, he didn’t believe that there would be any survivors in the car. An hour later though, he believes he witnessed a “miracle”.The three adult occupants of the car were crushed to death, but a two-year-old child was rescued with minor injuries. “Hundreds of us had gathered at the spot, but we were helpless. There was no way we could have pulled anyone out of the car. The truck and the soil it was carrying were too heavy for us,” said Sonu, who sleeps on the roadside and sells black salt on a cart.“We thought all inside the car were dead, but then, we heard the cries of a child and we were desperate to help the child,” Sonu said.According to Anurag (goes by a single name), a friend of the Singhal family that was involved in the mishap, a crane arrived about an hour later. The truck was removed and the car’s occupants were taken out of the mangled remains of the vehicle. “Only the child was alive. The others looked dead,” Anurag said.Anurag happened to be at the spot as he was among several residents from the neighbourhood in Rohini Sector 15 who were returning from a wedding in Gurugram. “We were in Gurugram to attend the wedding of the daughter of our former neighbour, Rajesh Goyal. The Singhal family was among the attendees,” Anurag said.Anurag reached the accident spot just moments after the mishap. “The child survived because he was sleeping on the rear seat. The car’s roof probably did not crush him,” Anurag said.The child’s parents, Sumit Singhal and Ruchi Singhal, got married over three years ago. They lived with Sumit’s parents and his younger sister in their five-storey home in Rohini Sector 15. The family had rented out some floors, and also had a thriving pulses processing unit in Bawana.Overloading menaceAs most of the soil being carried by the dumper had landed on the road and the Audi, police said they are not in a position to determine if the “offending vehicle” was overloaded.But investigators said it was possible that the dumper was overloaded. “The truck must have been going at a high speed, and the load it was carrying may have caused it to topple over,” a senior police officer said.According to data from the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways, the menace of overloading in goods vehicles has resulted in 817 mishaps and cost 141 lives in Delhi between 2015 and 2017.At the national level, overloading has been cited as the trigger for 1,94,153 mishaps and 67,349 deaths in the three years between 2015 and 2017. In that period, these mishaps accounted for anywhere between 11.9% and 15.4% of all accidents in India. In terms of deaths, overloading accounted for around 15% of all fatalities.Alok Kumar, joint commissioner of police (Delhi traffic police), said his personnel cannot prosecute goods vehicles for overloading. “We do not have the facility for weighing trucks and their goods because of which we cannot determine if they are overloaded,” the JCP said.",0

The STF busted the mass copying racket during the UP Board examination of physics paper.Police recovered Rs 12.50 lakh cash, solved answer sheets, fake identity cards of 12 invigilators, who were doing duty illegally. Besides, two pistols, 80 bullets, 16 mobile phones, 31 bank passbooks, four physics books, carbon papers and a SUV, from their possession.The STF arrested Yogendra Pal Singh, a school principal and centre superintendent, 12 fake invigilators including one from Haridwar, two solvers, one clerk and a teacher who was the mastermind behind the racket.The mass copying gang was operating at Janata Inter College, Muzaffarnagar and hired solvers from Delhi, Haryana and Uttarakhand were found taking the exam illegally, said police. According to STF, most of the invigilators were not regular teachers. They were hired by the centre superintendent to facilitate copying. These invigilators were teachers of physics, the subject for which the exam was on. This is a clear violation of exam rulebook that mandates that non subject teachers can only be made invigilator.SSP STF Abhishek Singh said as examination was being conducted under CCTV camera vigil and these invigilators were found dictating answer from outside the classroom. A team of STF led by Vimal Gautam along with DIoS Muzaffarnagar raided Janta Inter College and arrested many persons.Singh said after quizzing various people it came to light that one Intekab is the mastermind of the gang. After being interrogated, he revealed that he had large network of copying gang in bordering states of UP like Delhi, Haryana and Uttarakhand.“To help students pass the examination, the gang charges something between Rs 25,000 to Rs 55,000 from each student. Every year nearly 2000 students approach this gang to help them pass the examination. In return the gang makes about Rs 7-8 crore in exam,” SSP STF claimed.SSP, STF, said the teachers were caught solving the exam papers in the laboratory. They were using carbon papers to write multiple copies. They were dictating answers in such a way that CCTV cameras were unable to catch them.",0

607,"24th February 2010: When Sachin Tendulkar rewrote history books in GwaliorSachin Tendulkar is widely regarded as one of the best batsmen in the history of the game and on this day, nine years ago, the Indian superstar etched his name in history books against South Africa in Gwalior.Tendulkar became the first cricketer ever to score a double century in ODIs as he powered the hosts to a series-clinching win over the Proteas at the Captain Roop Singh Stadium.Riding on Tendulkar’s unbeaten 200, India put on a huge total of 401/3 in 50 overs. Depite AB De Villiers’101 ball 114, the visitors were dismissed for just 248 and they fell short by 153 runs.The Master Blaster’s innings included 25 boundaries and three massive sixes and he crossed the 200-run mark off just 147 deliveries at a healthy strike rate of 136.0.Tendulkar was rightly adjudged the man of the match as he showed the way to other that crossing the 200-run mark in ODIs was possible. Following Tendulkar’s heroics, many others took the leaf out of his book and went on to smash double centuries in the 50-over format of the game.India has most representation in this exclusive club as current vice-captain Rohit Sharma has done it thrice during the course of his illustrious career. Rohit’s 264 against Sri Lanka in Kolkata in 2014 also remains the highest individual score in ODIs.Apart from Tendulkar and Rohit, Virender Sehwag is the third Indian on this elite list as he smashed 219 against Windies in Indore in 2011.The other such cricketers are New Zealand’s Martin Guptill (237* vs WI), West Indies’ Chris Gayle (215 vs ZIM) and Pakistan’s Fakhar Zaman (210* vs ZIM).",0

The Government Railway Police (GRP) along with their counterparts at the Railway Protection Force (RPF) recently conducted a security audit of the stations, which revealed that there are at least 1090 unsecured spots between CSTM-Thane-Panvel and Churchgate-Bandra that need quick attention, according to Niket Kaushik, Commissioner, Government Railway Police (GRP).   Owing to heavy and uncontrolled footfall at the railway stations, the ‘minimum standard security’ apparatus continues to be compromised as all the stations have unauthorised entry and exit points. This makes all the stations unsafe and the railways have been informed to plug them, however, very little has been done.  The highest number of vulnerable points, 315, was found in Vashi GRP’s Thane-Vashi trans-harbour line, which is last on the list of security. “The audit is still underway and is being conducted by all the 17 police stations in Mumbai’s suburban section. The data will help to analyse the loopholes and improved coordination among the agencies and police. The concerned agencies (railways and BMC) are being informed about the findings for improving things on ground,” said Niket Kaushik, GRP commissioner.",1

US and North Korean negotiators have reached in advance and hammering out outcomes, if any, that could include the two countries exchanging liaison offices.Trump and Kim will hold multiple meetings, following the Singapore template from last summer, their first summit — a one-on-one, then one with their officials and a lunch, US officials have said.“We both expect a continuation of the progress made at first Summit in Singapore,” Trump wrote on Twitter Sunday.“Denuclearization?” he ended that post with a question mark.Also read | ‘Very, very bad situation between India and Pakistan’: Trump on Pulwama attackBut did not provide an answer. He went on, instead, reprise for North Korea the prospect of economic prosperity in exchange for giving up its nuclear weapons programme: “Chairman Kim realizes, perhaps better than anyone else, that without nuclear weapons, his country could fast become one of the great economic powers anywhere in the World. Because of its location and people (and him), it has more potential for rapid growth than any other nation!”Complete and verifiable denuclearization by North Korea is the key US goal but experts and US intelligence officials insist Pyongyang has not even made a start yet, though they agree it has also not conducted nuclear and missile tests since the two sides began talking earlier 2018, leading up to the June summit.North Korea is seeking, in return, a peace treaty to formally end the Korean war to replace the 1953 armistice, lifting of economic sanctions, and security guarantees. Kim hasn’t managed any of that yet yet, but his June meeting with Trump has given him a leg up over his father and grandfather, who ruled the country before him, as the first North Korean leader to meet a sitting American president.",0

(PTI Photo)The Indian Air Force (IAF) on Wednesday conducted a memorial fly-past at the Yelahanka air base for Wing Commander Sahil Gandhi, a day after the fighter pilot was killed in a mid-air collision between two British-origin Hawk advanced jet trainers while practising aerobatic manoeuvres for the five-day Aero India-2019.Three IAF fighter jets — a Sukhoi-30 fighter flanked by a Jaguar and a Tejas light combat aircraft — flew the time-honoured “missing man” formation to honour Gandhi at the inaugural fly-past of Asia’s biggest air show.“The formation pays tribute to the fallen pilot. If he was alive, he would have been flying too in the finger four formation,” said former IAF chief Air Chief Marshal Fali Major.Gandhi, 37, was part of the IAF’s renowned Surya Kiran Aerobatic Team (SKAT), which consists of the country’s finest pilots trained to perform complex stunts. Two other pilots injured in the twin Hawk crash - Wing Commander VT Shelke and Squadron Leader TJ Singh - are recuperating in an IAF hospital.A Rafale aircraft of the French air force also made a low pass during the flying display as a mark of respect to Gandhi, who hailed from Haryana’s Hisar. A radio call given by the French pilot announcing this was broadcast over the PA system on the ground. Captain Nativel Babouc, who flew the Rafale in a low pass to honour Gandhi, said, “It was my way to pay homage to the fallen pilot. We fighter pilots are one big family no matter which country we come from.”IAF chief Air Chief Marshal BS Dhanoa said it was too early to say what went wrong and only an investigation would reveal the cause of the accident. The jets were in a mirror manoeuvre – one flying inverted above the other – seconds before the collision that has become the major talking point at the 12th edition of the air show. While SKAT is not taking part in the air show any longer because IAF wants to pinpoint the reasons for the accident, the display team’s Hawks were seen parked outside an apron near the main runway of the air base.Defence minister Nirmala Sitharaman declared the air show open, asserting that it intended to put India on the global map as “a runway to a billion opportunities”.The IAF’s Sarang helicopter display team performed a string of breathtaking manoeuvres amid cheers and applause from the spectators, including ministers from foreign countries, and top military officials including the three service chiefs.Another highlight of the biennial show was a fly-by performed by a B-52 Stratofortress bomber that came from the Andersen Air Force Base in Guam.Of the seven fighter jets competing for an Indian programme to build 114 planes locally under the strategic partnership (SP) model, only Rafales, F-18s and F-16s were part of the flying display.",0

On Thursday, the Congress cited media reports to allege that Modi continued shooting for a film in the Corbett National Park on February 14 for “self propagation”, and stayed put till the evening despite the attack on a CRPF convoy in south Kashmir’s Pulwama district in the afternoon that day.Congress’ chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala, addressing a press conference, also claimed the prime minister continued to “have tea and samosas at seven o’clock in a PWD guest house when every single Indian household didn’t eat food (that day)”.",0
613,"‘Sabka vinaash’: Yogi Adityanath’s take on SP, BSP, and Congress in UPUttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath has said while the BJP’s motto was “Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas”, the opposition SP, BSP and the Congress in the state stood for “Sabka Vinaash” (destruction of everyone).His comments came when a discussion on the budget was underway at the Uttar Pradesh Legislative Assembly.“SABKA stands for SP (Samajwadi Party), BSP (Bahujan Samaj Party) and Congress. Our Sabka slogan speaks about development of all. Their Sabka speaks about destruction of everyone...We stand for Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikaas. Yours is Sabka Saath, Sabka Vinaash,” Adityanath said intervening the discussion.Taking a dig at the Congress, he said, “Every citizen of this country is proud of our traditions. If the Congress had tried to take pride in the country’s traditions, it would not have come to its lowest tally in the state and the country. This situation has come as the Congress had insulted the culture and traditions of the country.” “When you want to garner votes, you show your janeu (sacred threads worn by Hindus). People have even started telling their ‘Gotra’ (sub-caste)... And even the SP did not find the Congress suitable to include it in the SP-BSP alliance,” the chief minister said, targeting the opposition Congress in the state.Adityanath also took a jibe at Ram Gobind Chaudhary (SP), the Leader of Opposition in the UP Assembly. “If you (Ram Gobind Chaudhary) had even an iota of sympathy for the poor, you would have been with Shivpal Yadav’s political party and not with the SP. (Ram Manohar) Lohiaji had spoken about socialism, which is not seen in your party (SP). In reality, it is Shivpal Yadav who takes the name of Lohiaji. You (SP) people do not take his name,” he said.He briefed the House on the various aspects of the budget and spoke at length on the various schemes of the state government pertaining to women, girls, farmers, labourers, youth, villages, electricity, roads, Metro rail, development of airports, health and education.“In a nutshell, I can say that this is a holistic budget. This is a budget which has taken care of the interests of all sections of the society and has given a new impetus to development. This is a budget which has brought smile and prosperity on every face,” Adityanath said.He announced that the state government will soon enhance the honorarium of Anganwadi and ASHA workers, those in the Panchayati Raj Department, village sevaks and cooks who make mid-day meals.Speaking on the recent terror attack in Pulwama that claimed the lives of 40 CRPF personnel, Adityanath said, “The anger which is visible after the Pulwama terror attack is an eye-opener for the public representatives. If a person indulges in appeasement of self-interest, and encourages terrorism, then the same anger will be visible which is today seen on the streets.”The UP chief minister said the BJP government has worked hard to put the derailed system of the state back on track.“UP, which was languishing among the bottom states of the country during the governments of the SP and the BSP, is now on the path of becoming the number one,” Adityanath said.",0

We do not want to be an elitist company. That’s not -- we want to be an egalitarian company and we’ve got a lot of work going on in developing markets,” Williams was quoted as saying in a Burlington Times News report late on Sunday.During his speech, Williams discussed several topics, including the rising cost of the Apple products and inaccuracy of analyst cost estimates.“The stories that come out about the cost of our products (have been) the bane of my existence from the beginning of time, including our early days.“Analysts don’t really understand the cost of what we do and how much care we put into making our products,” he told students.Citing Apple Watch as an example, the tech giant COO said the company “built an entire physiology lab with 40 licensed nurses and enlisted the help of 10,000 participants to further study how calories are burned in various fitness exercises”.According to Apple CEO Tim Cook, there are several factors why iPhone sales are not picking up in the emerging markets.“The customers are holding on to their older iPhones a bit longer than in the past. When you pair this with the macroeconomic factors, particularly in emerging markets, it resulted in iPhone revenue that was down 15 per cent from last year,” Cook told analysts recently.Analysts say they expect some kind of price correction going forward as Apple has given indications that they will look at pricing outside the US closely now.",0

Four of the sixes came off Kevin O’Brien in the 17th over which reaped 28 runs in all.One giant hit off Shane Gelkate went over the stands and out of the ground.Zazai’s stocks have risen dramatically despite missing a place in the Indian Premier League this season.In October, he became only the third batsman to hit six sixes in a T20 over for his Afghanistan Premier League side Kabul Zwanan.He equalled the record for the fastest T20 half century in 12 balls in the same match.Stirling hardly knew who to throw into the breach as a bowler.Boyd Rankin finally claimed a wicket for the Irish when Ghani -- who made 73 off 43 balls -- played a careless shot over long-on that Joshua Little caught diving as he ran in from the boundary.While Stirling and Kevin O’Brien were no slouches, they never kept up with the mountainous run rate, which had risen to 17 by the 10th over.Afghanistan’s star bowler Rashid Khan came on for the 11th over and was furious when captain Asghar Afghan spilled a relatively simple catch off his first ball to give O’Brien a chance with Ireland on 109.O’Brien was bowled in the next over by Fareed Ahmad for a 37 which included two sixes.Rashid bowled Andy Balbirnie in the following over for two and Stirling started to run out of reliable partners.Mujeeb Ur Rahman claimed Stirling -- who as a consolation made Ireland’s top T20 score of 91 off 50 balls -- when he was caught by replacement Najeeb Tarakai on the boundary.The final match of the series is on Sunday. The two play five one-day internationals from February 28 and a one-off Test in March.",0

However, at a joint press conference called by the UD ministry, Delhi Metro and Reliance Infrastructure on Monday, the differences between the agencies emerged.Sudhir Krishna, secretary, urban development ministry, said, “There were no defects in the civil construction when the service on the line started in February 2010.” Sumit Banerjee, CEO (infrastructure), Reliance Infrastructure, countered: “There were damages since day one but they went unnoticed. They came to light during our recent annual inspection.”Meanwhile, the urban development ministry has ordered a proper examination. “Since the magnitude of damage is quite high, it has been ordered to examine all 2,100 bearings,” Krishna said.The ministry and the Railway board have formed a two-member inquiry committee to identify the responsible person/s or agency and investigate in details. As repair of these defects is likely to take a long time, the August deadline for the re-opening of the high-speed line will be missed, officials said.

The Trinamool Congress and the DMK, both of whom have to face assembly elections next year, had to do some shadow boxing so as not to be seen as openly supporting the increase.The opposition, including the Left and the BJP, predictably, went all out to attack the government, demanding a rollback and blaming it for further stoking inflation.Food inflation on Thursday rose marginally to 16.96 per cent from 16.12 per cent last week.For the Trinamool and the DMK, it was a delicate balancing act.Railway Minister Mamata Banerjee stayed away from the meeting of the Empowered Group of Ministers though the increase of diesel prices would directly impact her ministry. Railway ministry officials, however, said that although the the fuel hike would increase its expense on diesel by Rs 470 crore, passenger fares will remain untouched.Fertiliser and Chemical Minister M.K. Alagiri simply read out a note to say that the hike would push up prices of other items further. “Any further increase will hit the purchasing power of the lower middle income families,” he said.When he even proposed a rollback, Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee snapped: “What rollback?” Alagiri fell silent.Banerjee said later, “I am unhappy and we do not support the hike.” But she clarified, “We do not want to quarrel as it won’t look nice. I will talk to the government to reconsider”.The government did consult allies on Thursday before taking the decision.Petroleum Minister Murli Deora spoke to DMK’s A. Raja and Mukherjee had an hour-long discussion with Banerjee. The Trinamool leader made it clear that she will not attend the EgoM as it could send a wrong signal to her electorate.At Friday’s meeting, Agriculture Minister and NCP chief Sharad Pawar said that if the government wanted a hike it must not dither on it. “If God is willing, prices will come down in future.”The Congress was on the defensive. “The government must have been constrained to take this step,” said spokesperson Jayanthi Natarajan.Privately many Congress workers expressed their unhappiness with the hike that is being seen as hurting the aam aadmi.The BJP demanded that the taxes should be rationalised to make fuel cheaper and dismissed the government’s defence that it was the NDA that had started to dismantle the administered pricing mechanism first.",1

The chief minister’s offer came a day after Puri said the Delhi government will have to pay Rs 3,000 crore annually for five years to put off the metro fare hike, set to be implemented from Tuesday.

The report, published in thewire.in, said Shah’s company Temple Enterprises Pvt Limited was “engaged in negligible activity” in the financial years ending March 2013 and 2014 but “jumped to a turnover of Rs 80.5 crore in 2015-16”. The company had taken an unsecured loan during the year for Rs 15.78 crore, the news report said, adding that it finally wound up in October 2016 after posting a loss. Jay Shah issued a statement saying the article “makes false, derogatory and defamatory imputation against me by creating in the minds of right thinking people an impression that my business owes its ‘success’ to my father Sri Amit Bhai Shah’s political position.” Read the story here.Send your child to school or be locked up in jail with no food, water: UP ministerUttar Pradesh minister Om Prakash Rajbhar has warned that parents who fail to send their wards to schools will be locked up in police stations without food and water.

In an unprecedented move, the ministry has brought to an end a 36-year-old protocol where it was mandatory for general managers to present themselves on arrival and departure of the Railway Board chairman and other board members during zonal visits. As part of a massive overhaul of the culture of privilege prevalent in the ministry, the Railway Board has decided to do away with the instructions of a 1981 circular that mandated such protocol.

May and leading lights in the Conservative Party took to the print media on Sunday to warn of unrest paving the way for Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn into Downing Street. May appeared to have survived another threat to her leadership after a bid to oust her by former party chairman Grant Shapps collapsed when it did not find much support among party MPs.

After the win in Ranchi in the first T20 of the three-match series, Virat Kohli-led side can very well hope for another series triumph against the team from Down Under. The dominance of the Virat Kohli-led side in the past few months has shown its potential to be one of the greatest Indian sides ever. It very well reminds of the MS Dhoni-led Indian team that dominated world cricket a little while back. Even reaching the heights of Steve Smith or Ricky Ponting-led Australian cricket teams is no longer a distant dream, it seems. “In the current era there are many teams who are almost at par. So, it would be great if we achieve the same results now, what Australia did in old days,” Dhawan, who remained unbeaten on 15 in India’s nine-wicket win in the first T20I, said.

It has become a victim of coalition politics in both UPA-I and UPA-II. The ministry has become an orphan and is surviving without any protection or guidance,"" BJP spokesperson Jagat Prakash Nadda said.The party, led by its president Nitin Gadkari, condoled the death of over 60 people due to derailment of Kalka mail at Fatehpur in Uttar Pradesh on Sunday.Nadda held Prime Minister, who has kept the Railways portfolio with himself since Mamata Banerjee resigned to become chief minister of West Bengal, responsible for the poor state of affairs in the ministry.""The Prime Minister is squarely responsible for this... It is his weakness that he never intervened when Lalu Prasad and Mamata Banerjee were running the ministry,"" he said.He alleged that the UPA government was ""insensitive"" and warned that ""passing the buck"" will not do.Nadda also blamed former railway ministers Mamata Banerjee and Lalu Prasad for the problems being faced by Indian Railways today.""As Railway Minister in UPA-I, Prasad had made tall claims of profits and given wrong figures. He also projected himself as a management guru at that time. Mamata Banerjee, who succeeded him, deflated his tall claims. But this ministry has now become a joke which is unbearable,"" Nadda said.Referring to the recommendations of the HR Khanna committee, appointed by the NDA government to study rail safety and other issues, Nadda asked why it was shelved.""In 2002-03, the Khanna Committee had recommended a Rail Safety Fund with a corpus of Rs 15,000 crore. The Atal Bihari Vajpayee government had sanctioned Rs 17,000 crore after factoring in inflation,"" he said.Enumerating other achievements of the Railway ministry during the erstwhile NDA government, the BJP spokesperson maintained that 17,000 km of rail track renewal, building of 3,000 rail bridges, upgrading of signals at 950 stations and improvement in security and other policy matters were approved by the Vajpayee regime.He alleged that all these projects were abandoned by the ministry once Lalu Prasad took charge. He further accused Banerjee of contributing her bit to the deterioration of the ministry.""The Railway Ministry migrated to Kolkata during Mamata Banerjee's time. She had a Vision 2020 but we all know her vision right from the time she took office was something else,"" Nadda said, alluding to Banerjee's aim of becoming the chief minister of West Bengal during her tenure as railway minister.The BJP General Secretary said Sunday's accident was a result of lack of long term planning by the ministry.""The Minister of state for railways (Mukul Roy) was not ready to go to the site of the accident. He had to be told by the Prime Minister to go. Railways is suffering due to coalition compulsions. No monitoring of projects is being done. One lakh posts of traffic and security personnel are lying vacant. Political will is needed,"" Nadda said.In his condolence message, Gadkari said the government did not take immediate steps to improve rail safety and the situation deteriorated further. He urged the government to take prompt and effective steps for the safety of people.",1

So what is the harm in paying for a service that will be available on their mobile phone,” said a senior railway official, requesting anonymity.The mobile ticketing for suburban trains was first announced in the 2014-15 interim budget presented in February 2014. However, the project didn’t take off until July — its original deadline.With this service, commuters will be able to book tickets and renew seasonal passes on their mobile. Each commuter will receive a code via SMS after booking the ticket and the money will be deducted from their mobile wallet, which they have to create with the railways.Railway officials are also in the process of creating an interface with banks where the ticket amount can be also deducted through internet banking.The commuter has to insert this SMS code into an Automatic Ticket Vending Machine (ATVM) and procure the printed ticket. The service will initially be available at five stations on the Western Railway (WR) and Central Railway (CR), respectively.On CR, the service will be available at Kalyan, Kurla, Dadar, CST and Thane stations, while Churchgate, Bandra, Dadar, Andheri and Borivli on the WR will have the service.Gradually, these ATVMs will be installed at all stations, said the railway official.Commuter activists, however, claimed the additional charges are not justified.“Railways are not incurring much cost to provide the service. Rather, they should consistently increase the fare and invest in better rail infrastructure and new projects,” said Ashok Datar, transport expert.",1

Roads And Railways ProjectsBy Accommodation Times News ServiceThe Centre gave its green signal for investments worth more than Rs.27,000 crore in new highways and railway lines across the country to boost economic growth.The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) approved infrastructure projects worth Rs.27, 328 crore for expansion of railway lines in 11 states and development of 1,120 km national highways in five states.“The Cabinet decisions are a continuation of the government’s commitment to support infrastructure development particularly expanding the national highways beyond the existing ones,” said Manish Agarwal, partner and leader, infrastructure, PwC India. “This will augur well for passenger and freight movement and is very positive for the infrastructure sector, he said.Infrastructure boostThe government plans to increase its investments in the infrastructure sector. About 8,300 kilometres of roads involving more than Rs.1 lakh crore investments were revived, said Finance Minister Arun Jaitley in his Budget speech. Total investments earmarked in the current fiscal for roads and railways sectors amounts to Rs.2.18 lakh crore. The Centre is also augmenting port capacity by developing greenfield projects in both eastern and western coasts. In the aviation sector, the Centre plans to revive torpid airports.The railway expansion programme includes nine projects involving 1,937 km of track construction at an estimated cost of Rs.20, 867 crore. The projects include construction of second railway line between New Bongaigaon and Kamakhya in Assam. The government also gave its approval to build third and fourth railway line projects on the North South and East West Corridors of the Golden Quadrilateral.The Railway Ministry said the “fully saturated” Golden Quadrilateral will get a “big boost” helping in transportation of coal, minerals, steel and other commodities. This will also enable transportation of more passengers along these routes.“At present, the number of passengers and goods trains in the Golden Quadrilateral section is far more than its capacity resulting in heavy detention. These projects are essentially required for removing capacity constraints, reducing detention and for traffic growth,” the Railway Ministry said.Among the projects approved are third railway lines between Kharagpur and Adityapur (Jharkhand), Itarsi and Nagpur (Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra), Ballarshah and Kazipet (Maharashtra and Telangana) and Vijayawada and Gudur (Andhra Pradesh).Similar third railway lines will also be built between Rajnandgaon-Nagpur (Kalumna) in Chhattisgarh and Gondia, Bhandara and Nagpur Districts of Maharashtra, Mathura and Jhansi and Jhansi and Bina in Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh.Besides, the CCEA has also given its nod to construction of fourth railway line between Jharsuguda and Bilaspur (Odisha and Chattisgarh). The construction of these railway lines is expected to be completed in four to six years.Highway connectivityAs a part of the National Highways Interconnectivity Improvement Project (NHIIP), the government approved constructing 1,120 km national highways in Karnataka, Odisha, Bihar, Rajasthan and West Bengal with World Bank assistance. The work is scheduled to be completed by July 2024 at an estimated cost of Rs.6, 461 crore.These projects will ensure safe, fast and all weather movement of traffic on the proposed national highways mostly located in backward regions thereby improving socio-economic development, an official statement said. In a separate move, the CCEA has also approved waiver of penal interest on the Government of India loans availed by Cochin Port Trust to the tune of Rs.897 crore. The Cochin Port Trust had availed Rs.168 crore worth loans between 1936-37 and 1994-95 for various development activities from the Centre. Non-payment of loans had attracted penal interest of Rs.914 crore, according to an official statement.The Cabinet also approved leasing out 4,060 square metres of Airports Authority of India (AAI) land to Assam Industrial Development Corporation (AIDC) for setting up Centre for Perishable Cargo and its future expansion at the Guwahati Airport.",1
634,"Can we repair the train while it is running?Indian trains run at an average speed of 50-70km per hour — fairly low when compared to the trains in developed countries. Yet, train accidents in India are phenomenally higher in comparison. In 2016-17 alone, train accidents in India have resulted in 238 causalities. This despite the fact that the number of accidents ‘per million train kilometres’ in India has reduced to 0.1 in 2016-17 from 0.23 in 2006-07. Worse still, according to a study by Niti Aayog, six of every 10 rail accidents in India since 2012 have happened due to human negligence.Every time an accident happens, heads roll and a few railway officials are punished but clearly this does not seem to change the scenario much. Therefore, we may need to remind ourselves of how we landed ourselves into this situation and what is that we can do to improve it.Stocktaking must start from a simple acknowledgement that among other things, the Indian Railways has been treated as a political tool by successive governments. Back in the early 20th century, most of the Indian Railways was nationalised but since its budget formed a significant portion of the total finances of the exchequer, a practice of separate Railway budget was institutionalised from 1924 to ensure that it acts as a commercial undertaking having flexibility in financial matters and higher accountability in administration and operation.But over a period of time what evolved out of this arrangement was a split personality for Indian Railways – an observation also made in the Indian Railways Report 2001 authored under the chairmanship of Rakesh Mohan.The report suggests that on one hand Railways was to act like a self-sufficient commercial organisation while on the other, it has had large social obligations to discharge by virtue of the fact it was a government department.It goes without saying that the performance parameters of commercial projects can be quite different compared to social projects. While the former may entail focus on elements like revenue, profits or return on capital the latter may demand expansion of connectivity or increase in traffic.",1

636,"Castor seed production to be down by 20% in 2018-19: Solvent Extractors AssociationBY ET BUREAU | FEB 25, 2019, 01.12 PM ISTPost a Comment According to the castor crop survey conducted by the Solvent Extractors Association (SEA), the total production in India in 2018-19 is estimated to be down by 20% to 11.26 lakh tonnes in 2018- 19 from 14.16 lakh tonnes, estimated in 2017-18. The area and yield have declined mainly due to inadequate monsoons. The survey noted: ""Total area under castor in India for the year 2018-19 is estimated to be 769570 hectares as per the government’s estimates against 2017-18 estimate of 821600 hectare, which has decreased by 7% compared to the previous year. • Acreage has been reported to have declined in Gujarat, the largest growing state, but it is expected to be almost flat in Rajasthan and Andrhra Pradesh/Telangana. • Average yield for year 2018-19 is estimated slightly down, -12.6%, to 1520 Kg/Ha compared to 1740 Kg/Ha, based on farmer’s response about their yield expectation on present crop conditions."" SEA conducts Castor crop survey for crop estimation in major growing states like Gujarat, Rajasthan, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana every year. This year, SEA commissioned Indian Agribusiness Systems Ltd, known as “Agriwatch” in the industry, to conduct a crop estimation study in above states through field surveys and remote sense data analysis. Total area under castor in Gujarat for the year 2018-19 is taken to be 533800 hectares as per the government’s estimates, against last year’s estimate of 591000 hectares, which has declined by about 10% as compared to the previous year. Agriwatch field survey suggests area under castor to be less by 6% this year as compared to last year’s government estimate and is estimated at 554160 hectares. Using remote sensing technique, the castor acreage for the state is estimated at 549000 hectares, for .. The major reasons for lower acreage this year is less rainfall in key growing belt. ""Estimated average yield for year 2018-19 is expected to be 1751 Kg/ha against last year’s estimate of 2029Kg/ha, a fall by 13.7%. Overall, the farmers are expecting decline in yield this year due to weak monsoon, less growth of plants and less availability of water for irrigation. Total seed production in the state with decrease in area (-10%) and less yield (-13.7%), is estimated down to 9.35 lakh tons in 2018-19 from last year’s estimate of 12.00 lakh tons. The seed arrivals have started in mandis as farmers are selling in small lots to get the higher prevailing prices,"" observed the survey.",0
637,"Central Railway block on day dedicated to punctualityIn a major faux pas, the Central Railway (CR) will operate a six-hour block that will lead to the cancellation of 40 suburban trains and regulation of 20 long-distance trains on Sunday, which was dubbIn a major faux pas, the Central Railway (CR) will operate a six-hour block that will lead to the cancellation of 40 suburban trains and regulation of 20 long-distance trains on Sunday, which was dubbed Satarkata Diwas and, ironically, dedicated to punctuality.Each zonal railway was expected to show 100 per cent punctuality on the occasion, which was created to mark Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s two years in power. The initiative comes under the Hamsafar Saptah, which began on May 26 and will go on until June 1.Mr Modi had issued a diktat across 17 zonal railways, in which instructions have been given that they should observe Sewa Divas on May 28 (Saturday) and Satarkata Diwas on May 29. The Prime Minister has asked railway officers to get down to the grass-roots level on Sewa Divas and travel in trains that they run for the common man.The senior officers were also instructed to talk to passengers themselves and understand their grouses. On the following day — Satarkata Diwas — railway officials were supposed to maintain the best punctuality that is humanly possible by showing a scoreboard of 100 per cent.However, the CR has decided to operate a six-hour block from 12 am on Sunday for laying down girders for the Kasaiwada bridge at Kurla.The CR had demolished the bridge back in December last year, fearing a repeat of the Hancock bridge incident.The Railways could not bring in new rolling stock of a much greater height than old trains, as officials were afraid that the overhead equipment would crash into the bridge, which was located between the Suburban railway stations of Sandhurst Road and Byculla.A railway official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, admitted that the block should have been operated a long time ago.“The fact of the matter is the CR should have operated this block way back. It unnecessarily wasted time on other things and no one gave any thought to the Prime Minister’s anniversary and that he might declare some railway initiative,” said the official.Some officials feel that the block should have been cancelled after the railway week was declared by the railway ministry on May 25, but said that they couldn’t deny that if the block of the bridge was not carried out this weekend, they would have had to wait until the post-monsoon period.“Kurla residents are angry as it is because Ramzan is round the corner and the bridge, which is the only connect the east and west, is nowhere near completion. At the same time, it looks like we are going against the instructions from Delhi and saying we have too much work. But we could afford to not operate the block this weekend had the senior officials done the Kurla work on time,” the official said.",1

Jagan Reddy is Naidu’s bitter rival and a strong contender for the chief minister’s post.Srinivas, the father-in-law of actor and grandson of matinee idol NT Rama Rao Jr NTR, evaded a direct reply from the media on whether he would be joining Jagan’s party. Rama Rao was the founder of the TDP.He is reportedly aspiring for a YSRC ticket from either Guntur Lok Sabha seat or Chilakaluripet assembly segment in Guntur district in the general elections to be held this year. Sources in the TDP said Srinivas is a strong contender for a ticket for Chilakaluripet assembly segment since 2004. But Naidu, it is said, did not entertain his requests to avoid criticism of supporting dynastic politics.Jr NTR is married to Srinivas’ daughter Lakshmi Pranathi, who is the granddaughter of Naidu’s sister. The daughter of the chief minister’s sister is married to Srinivas. And, Naidu is NTR’s younger son-in-law. Srinivas founded a regional TV channel Studio N, which was reportedly taken over by Naidu’s son and IT minister Nara Lokesh.Daggubati Venkateswara Rao, the elder son-in-law of NTR, also met Jagan Reddy on January 27 wishing to join the YSRC and eying a ticket for his NRI son Hithesh.TDP spokesperson Dokka Manikya Varaprasad said Srinivas and Daggubati met Jagan Reddy just for seats.Srinivas’ meeting came right after Lok Sabha member P Ravindranath resigned from the Telugu Desam Party and joined the YSRC in the presence of Jagan Reddy.Jr NTR, who took an active part in the 2009 election campaign for the TDP, was allegedly sidelined in the legacy politics which shifted from the NTR family to Naidu after the chief minister took over the party reins from NTR in 1995.The actor’s father and NTR’s elder son Harikrishna, who was recently killed in a road accident, also remained away from party activities after serving the TDP as a politburo member.",0

Demand for cars, two-wheelers, white goods is sluggish. Consumer non-durables, the growth is over 12%. It is the consumer durable which is sluggish and in negative growth,"" he told PTI in an interview in New Delhi.He said manufacturing capacity is there but sentiments must change for buying durable goods.""That is one part of manufacturing. The other part of manufacturing is the core sectors - steel, iron ore, coal, power, minerals. Manufacturing must grow there also. Output must increase. We must produce more coal, more iron ore, more steel, more aluminium. That will happen as the upturn takes place,"" he said.For example, the minister said, coal production has improved while iron ore which is caught in a number of litigations will hopefully clear with Supreme Court hearing the case.""But many other core industries, the projects are stalled which is why we have now identified the projects which are stalled and we are trying to remove these bottlenecks and things will begin to move.""I think work is at pace. A special cell has been constituted. The Cabinet Secretariat is looking at the projects that can be cleared in next few week.If they require a decision by the Cabinet Committee on Investment (CCI), we will bring it. Once the core sector production goes up, you will find the industrial sector moves up and manufacturing also moves up,"" he said.Chidambaram said the Indian economy was taking time to return to high growth trajectory because of the problems in the western economies.""The upturn (in global economy) that is expected has not taken place. At the same time there is no spiralling down either. I think our economy is getting stabilised. There are some weaknesses ... There are signs that we are moving towards a more stable period. It will take time,"" he said.The minister said the upturn will not happen quickly. ""It is a slow climb. The correct approach is to keep the focus on long term. There are no quick fixes. Take measures for long term and while these measures get implemented, the medium and short term will be addressed,"" he said.The government in recent weeks taken a number of decisions like hiking gas prices, setting up of coal regulator and allowing power producers to import coal to meet shortage.""The last few weeks we have taken a number of measures keeping the long term in mind. They will yield result on the long term, but as they yield result in long term the medium and short term problems will be addressed. There will be many more decisions in July,"" Chidambaram said.He said the Union Cabinet will decide on raising FDI caps in different sectors in the second or third week of this month.""Papers will have to come from the ministry of railway, from the ministry of coal, ministry of mines, from Planning Commission, from the ministry of petroleum, ministry of fertilisers.

646,"Data on mishaps suggest railways’ track record has actually improvedIn the past, when there were two sources to find the number of accident in railways, people often tried to match the two, failing to recognise there were definitional differences between themFor purposes of reporting and analysis, Indian Railways actually classifies accidents under several heads – from A to R(AFP)The National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) brings out an annual publication, Crime in India. In the past, this has also been used as source for figures on railway accidents. For example, in 2015, 26,066 people died because of railway accidents and 2,650 because of railway crossing accidents. Since 2016, NCRB no longer publishes figures on railway accidents. It only has numbers on crimes in railways. Therefore, the sole source for data on railway accidents is now Indian Railways (IR), such as Indian Railways, Year Book.In the past, when there were two sources, people often tried to match the two, failing to recognise there were definitional differences between them. Let me give you a quote from the latest Year Book. “There were 103 consequential train accidents in 2016-17 as compared to 106 accidents during 2015-16.” This does not include Konkan Railway. Notice the qualifier. We think IR reports all accidents; but IR reports only “consequential accidents”, or “serious accidents”. What is a consequential accident? An accident is anything that adversely affects the engine, rolling stock, permanent way and works, fixed installations, communications, passengers or railway servants. We usually think of accidents from a passenger perspective. But there are other angles.For purposes of reporting and analysis, IR actually classifies accidents under several heads — from A to R. For instance, A1 and A3 will be collisions of trains carrying passengers; A2 or A4 collisions of trains not carrying passengers; B represents fire or explosion in trains; C, trains running into road traffic and/or road traffic running into trains at level crossings; D, derailments; E, other train accidents; F, averted collisions; G, breach of block (a block is a segment of the track) rules; H, a train passing a signal at danger; J, equipment failures; K, failure of permanent way; L, failure of electrical equipment; M, failure of signalling and telecommunication; N, unusual incidents; P, casualties; Q, other incidents; and R, miscellaneous.What’s the difference between an unusual incident and other incident? N would be wrecking or sabotage, not usually expected. Q6 would be something like “blockade to train services due to agitation”, not something that can be classified as an unusual incident. You can see why IR’s approach to accidents is different. L2 is “no tension in OHE (overhead equipment) for more than three minutes”. This may not fit with our usual perception of an accident, but the effect can be disastrous.Read moreTo improve performance, Indian Railways must streamline the flow of trafficAcquiring land for bullet train project may get delayed, says Piyush GoyalWe are still left with the question. What is a consequential or serious accident? Certain threshold values are defined for loss to railway property and interruption to communications. A serious accident is one where there is a loss of life or grievous hurt to passengers, or those threshold values are exceeded, or where the Commissioner of Railway Safety (CRS) thinks an inquiry is needed. Data on railway accidents are also available through CRS. However, CRS doesn’t enquire into every railway accident and CRS data about accidents only include those where there has been a CRS inquiry.That Year Book will also tell you IR attended to 982 accidents in 2016-17. How can this possibly match with 103? It doesn’t because 103 refers to those that are “consequential”. There are some exclusion clauses that must be noted too: “ (a) cases of trespassers run over and injured or killed through their own carelessness or of passengers injured or killed through their own carelessness; and (b) cases involving persons being Railways servant or holding valid passes/tickets or otherwise who are killed or grievously injured while travelling outside the rolling stock of a passenger train such as on foot board, roof or buffer but excluding the inside of vestibules between coaches or run over at a level crossing or elsewhere on the railway track by a train; and (c) level crossing accident where no passenger or railway employee is killed or grievously hurt unless the Chief Commissioner of Railway Safety or Commissioner of Railway Safety is of the opinion that the accident requires the holding of an inquiry by the Commissioner of Railway Safety.”The exclusion clause makes it clear that a serious accident only includes instances where there is IR culpability. We might want to change this, but that’s the way it is today.The next time you see a figure on railway accidents, bear these in mind. If you want to check IR’s track record, ask yourself what you are interested in. Fatalities and/or injuries on trains, or fatalities/injuries at level crossings? Collisions, derailments, fires? Whatever the yardstick, you will find (a) cross-country, IR doesn’t do that badly; (b) Over time, the performance has improved. Outside the Year Book, there are 2017-18 numbers and they tell the same story.Bibek Debroy is chairman of Economic Advisory Council to the prime minister and a member of Niti AayogThe views expressed are personal",0
647,"Decision soon on removal of Pakistan cricketers’ photos from Eden Gardens: Sourav GangulyFormer India captain and Bengal cricket boss Sourav Ganguly Saturday said a decision would be taken soon on removal of Pakistan cricketers’ photographs, including that of PM Imran Khan, from the walls of Eden Gardens in the wake of the Pulwama terror attack.Ganguly’s comment came after BJP’s youth wing workers protested in front of the Eden Gardens, seeking removal of photographs of Imran and other Pakistani cricketers from the walls of the stadium.At least 64 activists of BJP youth wing were arrested for staging protest in front of the iconic Eden Gardens, a senior police officer said. They were later released on bail.“We are working on it. There will be a decision soon,” Ganguly told reporters when asked about the removal of photos.The state cricket associations of Vidarbha, Punjab and Rajasthan have already removed pictures of Pakistan cricketers in the aftermath of the terror attack which killed more than 40 CRPF personnel. Pakistan-based terror outfit, Jaish-e-Mohammad, has claims responsibility of the attack.Ganguly had earlier backed a complete boycott of cricketing ties with Pakistan, saying not playing the arch-rivals in the upcoming World Cup won’t have much of an impact on the Indian team’s campaign at the mega event in May-July.Days later, Sachin Tendulkar said he would ‘hate’ to give away two points to Pakistan by not playing in the World Cup and India should rather beat them again in the showpiece event to maintain their unbeaten record over the arch-rivals.“He wants two points against Pakistan, I want the World Cup so...he wants two points I want the World Cup. Whichever way you look at it,” Ganguly said, reacting to Tendulkar’s comments.Eden Gardens has photographs of Imran, Wasim Akram and others kept in non-public areas of the stadium.Former and current cricketers have expressed varied opinions on severing cricketing ties with Pakistan.Many ministers of West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee’s cabinet, including former Bengal captain Lakshmi Ratna Shukla, hit out at BJP for trying to divert nation’s attention from terrorism.“We are more keen on removing terrorism from the world rather than pulling down photographs (of sportspersons). The BJP is trying to divert the attention from the current issue of terror attack. This is clear politics going on in the country,” Shukla said.State Municipal minister and city mayor Firhad Hakim when contacted said people should not confuse politics with sports and culture.Former cricketer and current Bengal coach Arun Lal said that the country was going through an emotional time and countrymen were venting out their feelings in different ways.“I can understand the feelings of my countrymen. I also share the same. This is a very emotional time. We have lost some of our brave brothers and obviously the country is hurt.

I have a good news for you all. The AAP government has covered your medical and social security needs by allocating Rs 50 crore in our budget, which will be presented next week. The allocation will be in effect from April 1,” he said.The CM said this amount was not a one-time fund and that it would be an annual allocation, which is likely to increase year on year.In a second sop to the lawyers, Kejriwal promised that after the Lok Sabha elections, the Delhi government would direct the Delhi Electricity Regulatory Commission (DERC) to permanently change electricity connections of their chambers from commercial to domestic.“This will help you save a lot on your electricity bills. The Delhi government has been giving Rs 230 crore as subsidy to lawyers at present to match the difference. Once DERC makes this change in its tariff order after elections, then this subsidy will not be required,” he said.Kejriwal appealed to the lawyers to vote for AAP in the upcoming general elections so that Delhi could get the full statehood status.“Make us win on all seven seats, we will give full statehood to Delhi. We will raise the matter in Parliament. The powers we enjoy now is not even 10% of what Sheila Dikshit used to enjoy in her 15-year rule in Delhi. Now, I being the CM cannot even appoint my own peon,” he said.",0

However, intelligence sources said that explosives, safety fuses, aluminium electric detonators and cords have been found at some of the shut quarries in south Kashmir. “We don’t want to leave anything to chance. It’s not easy to carry RDX, or any explosive material, in a huge amount in a car in a single day. We want to eliminate the possibility of the role of any local mining quarry in keeping the explosives at a safe place,” said a senior J&K intelligence official. Officials believe that the Jaish terrorist could not have brought the entire cache of explosives at one go and was certainly provided logistic support of these business units. Sleuths have also launched a manhunt for stolen vehicles reported between January first week and February 14 following the uncertainty over the make and model of the car used in the attack. Both NIA and J&K Police sleuths have been divided over the car model, whether it was a Maruti Eeco or Ford Ecosport. Did Pulwama suicide bomber hide explosives in stone quarry? PULWAMA/SRINAGAR: Intelligence sleuths across security establishments in Jammu and Kashmir will now be preparing a list of stone quarries that had got shut in south Kashmir in the last few months amid suspicion that Pulwama suicide bomber Adil Ahmad Dar may have hidden explosives in one of these units. Sources in intelligence agencies said while it was likely that the Jaish-e-Mohammad terrorist had used imported military grade RDX from Pakistan in the IED used in the February 14 Pulwama attack, the sophisticated gadgetry could have been provided at one of the local quarries. There are about 30-odd quarries in south Kashmir, including in Pulwama, Anantnag and Shopian. These quarries often use illegally procured explosives and detonators.

652,"Don't mind losing my job, says TrivediRailway minister Dinesh Trivedi had promised a “revolutionary” rail budget to some of his cabinet colleagues on Tuesday. But his party chief Mamata Banerjee smelled a “rebellion” in Trivedi’s budget instead after he hiked passenger fare—allegedly keeping her in the dark—and left him with two options: roll back the hike or quit.For the first time in the history of parliament, the railway minister’s own party opposed the budget and left him in the lurch. Many in the party believe, Trivedi will have to make a quick choice as Mamata Banerjee ruled out any compromise on her “pro-people” stand.Trivedi, however, tried to put a brave face: “I have done my work as the railway minister. Now I leave the rest to the God.”Although fares have been raised across all sections, a roll back in the suburban (2 paise per km), second class (3 paise per km) and sleeper class (5 paise per km) may mollify the Trinamool chief, sources close to her told HT. Banerjee reportedly sees these fare tweaks as anti-poor and anti-aam aadmi.If Trivedi refuses to roll-back and puts in papers before the rail budget is passed, that would be another unprecedented event in parliament’s history. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh will then have to steer the budget till its passage. The option of asking Trivedi to continue till the passing of the budget also remains with the PM. However, Mamata Banerjee may not agree to such arrangement. Poll: Is it time for Cong to part ways with Mamata?A furious Trinamool chief Mamata Banerjee, who had repeatedly warned Trivedi against tinkering with passenger fares in the run-up to the budget, claimed that the railway minister did not consult the party before raising the fares. There was no direct communication between the railway minister and his political boss“As railway minister, he has the right to take own budget decisions. But the fare hike is totally against the policies of Mamata Banerjee and the party,” Trinamool’s parliamentary party chief Sudip Bandopadhyay told HT after a livid Banerjee called him from Nandigram area of West Bengal and vented her ire.Banerjee’s temper reportedly further soared at Trivedi’s praises for the finance ministry. Railway ministry got a loan of Rs 3000 crore from the government to tide over its immediate financial crunch.“Trivedi may shower lofty praises on the finance ministry but that ministry has offered no help to make West Bengal a financially stable state.”Trying to bring the Indian railway back on track, Dinesh Trivedi gets derailed in Trinamool’s political tracks.",1
653,"Drunk drivers are a Delhi policeman’s nightmareDelhi Traffic Police officers say that “hostility” from drunk drivers is one of many reasons why just over 100 motorists were prosecuted for the offence everyday on an average last year in the national capital.Traffic police personnel in the national capital say they are frequently threatened, sometimes assaulted or even mowed down by motorists when they attempt to prosecute drunk driving.(HT?File )“Blow into the alcometer,” the traffic policeman’s order was loud and clear. The SUV driver pretended to blow, but actually held his breath towards the end. The policeman knew just how to deal with the situation. “Loudly count till 10,” was the next command.In the next few seconds, the policeman had scientific evidence of the motorist having 105 mg of alcohol per 100 ml of blood, more than thrice the permissible limit. But what followed next was just what the policeman at the picket near Connaught Place fears every evening.The policeman had to fight off threats of action and repeated phone calls asking him to let go of the driver.This was a relatively much easier situation for the policeman to handle.Traffic police personnel in the national capital say they are frequently threatened, sometimes assaulted or even mowed down by motorists when they attempt to prosecute drunk driving.On better days, a motorist snatches away their alcometer as was seen at Barakhamba Road last November.Traffic Police officers say that “hostility” from drunk drivers is one of many reasons why just over 100 motorists were prosecuted for the offence everyday on an average last year in the national capital.The 37,188 prosecutions for drunk driving in 2018 were 11% more than the 33,343 previous year, but road safety experts say these figures are just the “tip of an iceberg”.“The drunk driving checking is not as frequent and widespread given how rampant the menace is in Delhi. A driver’s judgement is badly impaired after drinking and he is just lucky to reach his destination without harming anyone,” says Piyush Tewari, founder of NGO SafeLife Foundation.As per a study in America, an increase of Blood Alcohol Concentration by 0.02% doubles the relative risk of a vehicle crash among 16-20 year old males. That risk increases to 52 times when the BAC is between 0.08% and 0.10%.In India, motorists are not allowed to drive if the alcohol content is found to be over 30 milligrams per 100 millilitres of blood.According to a late last year’s survey of 5,000 Delhi motorists who drink, 3,605 (72.1%) of them admitted to drinking after driving. The survey, which was conducted by NGO ‘Community Against Drunken Driving’, found that 1,768 of those drivers said they regularly took to the wheel after drinking while 1,837 said they drove under the influence of alcohol only occasionally.More importantly, 78.6% of the respondents said they were not checked for drunk driving in the last six months of the survey.“The enforcement agencies do not take the issue as seriously as it should be. They view it as a seasonal traffic offence which happens during festivals like Holi, Diwali and new years,” says Prince Singhal, the NGO’s founder.According to the 2017 data put out by the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways, drunk driving caused 124 mishaps in Delhi and left 24 people dead and 126 injured. Across the country, drunk driving was the reason for 14,071 mishaps which killed 4,776 people and injured 11,776.But Tewari dismisses the data saying that most drunk drivers get away after causing an accident, leaving investigators clueless about the condition of the driver.“Delhi is a hub of hit and run cases. Many motorists abandon their vehicles after a mishap. When they are caught after a day or two, there is no evidence of drunk driving,” says Tewari.The act of fleeing after a mishap or fighting with the police after getting caught for drunk driving arises from the relatively tough penalties for drunken driving, says Alok Kumar, joint commissioner of police (Delhi Traffic Police).“Drunk driving is one of five traffic violations which lead to seizure of driving license for three months. No motorist wants to part with their license. I haven’t heard of one drunk driver who accepted the penalties without fighting with the traffic police on duty,” says Kumar.What also scares the motorists is the possible arrest and imprisonment up to six months, impounding of their vehicles and penalty of Rs 2,000. “The repeat offenders are the ones who are usually the most aggressive because they can be jailed up to three years and fined Rs 3,000,” says JCP Kumar.Out on the roads, the traffic police officers say they not only face a host of excuses and tricks by offenders, but also violent behaviour that risks the lives of the general public.“Each of these drunk drivers knows some influential person or the other. It becomes very uncomfortable for us to fend them off. In case the driver doesn’t know someone who can bail him out, he will try to take a U-turn or speed away, without bothering about its consequences,” says a traffic police inspector in west Delhi’s Rajouri Garden.JCP Kumar says that after drinking most drivers have a “false sense of bravado” and believe they can drive better.The CADD study found that one in every four of its respondents believed they drive better after drinking.",0
654,"Dubai-bound plane hijacker had issues with wife, wanted to speak to Bangladesh PM:?OfficialsBangladeshi commandoes shot a passenger on Sunday who had tried to enter the cockpit of a Biman Bangladesh Airlines flight after waving a gun and threatening to blow up the plane, airline and aviation authority officials said.The passenger, who had said he had a personal issue with his wife and told the pilot he wanted to speak to Bangladesh’s Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, died later from the injuries suffered after the commandos stormed the plane at Chittagong’s Shah Amanat International Airport, officials said.“We tried to arrest him or get him to surrender but he refused and then we shot him,” said Major General S M Motiur Rahman of the Bangladesh Army.The man’s threat to blow up the plane, which was on its way to Dubai from Dhaka via Chittagong, led its pilots to make an emergency landing.Before the commandos moved in, all 142 passengers and most of the crew had been let off the aircraft unharmed. One crew member had been held hostage, the officials said.Air Vice Marshal Nayeem Hasan, chairman of the Civil Aviation Authority of Bangladesh, told reporters at a news conference that as well as holding what appeared to be a pistol the passenger said he had explosives bound to his body.With the plane close to Chittagong after leaving Dhaka, the passenger stood up from his seat and tried to go to the cockpit, according to aviation officials. When a member of the crew blocked his way, he showed his pistol.He then said he had explosives and if they didn’t open the door of the cockpit he would blow up the plane, officials said. Other members of the crew alerted the pilots to the problem and they asked air traffic control for an emergency landing.It was not immediately clear if he had explosives, though the pistol was real, according to a senior aviation official. It also wasn’t immediately clear if the pistol was loaded or how it got through security at the airport in Dhaka.The security questions are a matter of concern and would be the subject of an investigation, said the aviation official.The man appeared to be in his 20s, and was probably Bangladeshi as he was speaking Bangla, but his identity was not yet clear, Hasan said.",0
655,"Ease in procuring licences makes Delhi’s roads dangerousOut of 10 major cities, Delhi stood sixth in the list of drivers who had procured a licence without taking a test.There are 1,200 unauthorised motor training institutes in Delhi, a plea in Delhi High Court said.(HT?File )Overtaking from the wrong side, inching bumper-to-bumper with the car in front and wrongly navigating the city’s roundabouts — Delhi’s drivers have a lot to learn when it comes to safe driving practices.But if these basic rules were largely ignored, then how did these drivers get their licences?The Delhi government has of late started a major crackdown against the growing corruption in regional transport offices by launching dedicated helplines to report cases of corruption. The ease in procuring drivers’ licences in the city, however, was an issue that was ignored for years.This resulted in the growth of untrained drivers who know little about the rules to be followed once they are behind the wheels.Till very recently, touts who offered to even appear in tests on your behalf for a meagre payment of Rs 3,000-Rs 4,000, were a regular sight at transport offices.“We have a no-tolerance policy for touts who take bribes and offer to issue licences. We conduct regular inspections and have also put up boards for the awareness of people to report such activities,” said Delhi’s transport minister Kailash Gahlot.Startling figuresData released by the Union ministry of road transport and highways (MoRTH) showed that in 2017, around 80% of road accidents in India was caused by valid licence holders.A 2018 survey by road safety NGO SaveLife Foundation also corroborated this dangerous trend. Data showed that 59% driving licence holders in India never took a test and thus did not completely understand road safety rules.Delhi did not fare too well in this test either.Out of 10 major cities, Delhi stood sixth in the list of drivers who had procured a licence without taking a test. At least 54% of Delhiites, compared to the national average of 59%, claimed to have not taken the competency test while applying for their licences.Unauthorised driving schoolsA plea filed in Delhi High Court last year had sought action against around 1,200 unauthorised motor training institutes that had mushroomed in the national capital.The classes imparted by these private schools are usually spread over 15 days and comprise six to seven hours of training and charge anywhere between Rs 1,800 and Rs 2,500.A student, who may have never sat in the driver’s seat, is directly ushered onto the busy and dangerous roads of the city on the first day of the class.“There is nothing to worry. We have full control of the vehicle,” says Hari Lal, a 37-year-old trainer at a driving school in west Delhi.By mentioning control, Lal was referring to an additional set of brakes and clutch fitted into the passenger’s side of the car.“There is no chance of an accident. I’ll apply brakes the moment a student loses control of the steering,” he adds.Many students say they feel confident while being trained, but are clueless while taking their own vehicles on the roads later.“I was caught in a massive jam and just didn’t know how to negotiate my way out. I had to seek the help of another motorist to get out of the situation,” said Deepa Vijay, who was trained by an unauthorised school.Nitin Kumar, an IT professional, said he found the training imparted to be inadequate. “I had to go through the training a second time because I wasn’t taught how to reverse, how to do parallel parking, how to shift lanes or the right use of mirrors,” said Kumar.Kumar said he was never taught how to drive a car on a flyover in busy traffic. “There were many important instructions I never received. I took to YouTube videos to learn important things myself,” said Kumar.But Girish Sharma, president of All India Motor Driving School Association, believes that those trained by even the unauthorised schools are better than those who learn by themselves or are trained by family or friends. He said that barely 10% of all motorists seek training from driving schools.“The trainers are mostly those who quit authorised driving schools or are awaiting licence. They teach their students about road signs, how to handle practical situations, to ensure there is no one in front of or behind the car when they switch start a car,” said Sharma, adding that even the unauthorised school trainers did more good than bad.But Sharma said it was necessary that only authorised motor driving training schools were allowed to operate so that only properly trained people were allowed to teach others.Many learners said that these trainers also doubled up as agents who promised to help them get driving licences easily. “I have to attend the driving test, but I have been assured that I will pass, no matter my performance,” said a learner, who didn’t want to identify himself.Tougher tests and uniform licensingFrom July this year, all states will have to issue uniform licences with security features, which will allow police and security agency to access driver information on the spot. Road safety experts, however, said that the need of the hour is to fix the process of licence procurement.“The process of driver tests needs to be made more transparent. Learners’ tests need to ensure that the applicant knows the basic rules of driving before they hit the road,” said Madhumita Deshpandey, co-founder of Road Safety Records, a Delhi-based research organisation, which focuses on road infrastructure and safety.Recently, Delhi introduced a one-of-a-kind automated track test centre in Sarai Kale Khan. The centre makes getting a drivers’ licence difficult by stimulating tougher driving conditions.Experts also said that certifying driving trainers under government rules will also help ensure the training is up to the mark. In several cities in the US, retired police officials take up the task of training new drivers to ensure that the theory of driving is also mastered.",0
656,"Eight killed in 12-vehicle pile-up on Rohtak highwaySeveral accidents were reported from highways in the Gangetic plains which was covered by dense fog on Monday morning, reducing the visibility to bare minimum.Eight persons, including seven women, were killed in a vehicle pile-up due to dense fog on the Rohtak-Rewari highway in Haryana on Monday, police said. At least 10 others were injured in the accident that took place in Jhajjar district in which over 12 vehicles, including a school bus, were involved, they said.Several accidents were reported from highways in the Gangetic plains which was covered by dense fog on Monday morning, reducing the visibility to bare minimum. Former state health minister Satyanarayan Lathar was killed in Jind after an unidentified vehicle hit him when he was walking home from his petrol pump late on Sunday night, police said.According to police, all the victims in the Jhajjar accident were from Kirdodh village and were going to Najafgarh in Delhi in a jeep to condole the death of a relative there. The jeep collided with a pick-up vehicle and was hit by a speeding truck from behind, police said, adding that the injured were taken to Pt BD Sharma Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences in Rohtak.“Eight persons were killed in the accident that took place in the early morning. At least 12 vehicles were involved in the pile-up,” said Seema Devi, station house officer, Jhajjar police station.The pile-up occurred after the two vehicles collided on Badli Flyover on National Highway-71 and around 10 more piled up behind them due to poor visibility, leading to more injuries. There was a school bus involved in the accident, which led to a two-kilometre traffic jam, but none of the passengers was injured, police said.Seven women and one man who were sitting in the back of the jeep were killed, while two more sitting in the same vehicle were critically injured. The deceased have been identified as Satpal Kumar (48), his wife Kanta Devi (40), Santosh Devi (52), Prem Lata (50), Laxmi Devi (63), Ram Kali (35), Sheela Devi (61) and Khajani Devi (54). They were cremated in the village Monday afternoon amid a pall of gloom.“A woman in Satpal’s relation had died in Najafgarh, for which the entire family was going there to pay our condolence. The visibility was very poor due to fog. Only 20 minutes in journey, we were hit by a truck from behind and all this happened,” said Dheeraj, son of Santosh.The Haryana government has announced a compensation of Rs 2 lakh to the kin of the deceased. “Compensation of Rs 2 lakh will be given to the kin of the deceased, Rs 1 lakh to those severely injured and Rs 50,000 to those with minor injuries,” Haryana minister OP Dhankar said.The northern part of the country, including Haryana and Punjab, has been reeling under the cold wave for the past one week. “Cold weather combined with the availability of moisture will result in foggy conditions over Northwest India. This dense fog is likely to reduce visibility over Punjab, Haryana, North Rajasthan, Delhi and Uttar Pradesh, resulting in difficulty for commuters in the morning and noon hours,” stated Skymet, a private weather forecasting agency.Dense to very dense fog was observed at isolated places over Punjab and West Rajasthan and moderate fog at isolated places over Haryana, Chandigarh, Delhi and West Uttar Pradesh in the morning hours.

These were unserviceable anti-aircraft ammunition.On average, unserviceable ammunition has caused 65-70 accidents annually since 2013-2014.In May this year, an official of the Ordinance Factory died during a routine check of L-70 ammunition at a forward ammunition depot near Pathankot in Punjab. “The accident happened when a validation exercise for L-70 rounds was being carried. The round went off accidentally killing an OF official,” a senior army officer who didn’t want to be named said.Apart from ammunition for the L-70 guns, ammunition for tanks and Armoured Personnel Carriers are also a cause of concern for the Indian ArmyAs many as 19 personnel, including two officers, died when faulty anti-tank mines exploded at the Central Ammunition Depot in Phulgaon in May 2016. Surprisingly, while an internal inquiry pinned the blame on the Ordnance Factory and some of its officials, no was held accountable. Two officials found to be responsible by the inquiry have even superannuated, according to a second Ministry of Defence official who did not want to be named .An audit of faulty ammunition being done by the Department of Defence Production , which supervises the Ordnance Factory, was stopped following the death, this official added. “The Indian army has been promised an improved version of L-70 ammunition fuse next year by the Ordnance Factory Boards. The audit has restarted in July”.The issue is technology, a retired army officer said.“Ordnance factories have not been up to date with the technology upgrades; recently, Indian made ammunition for the newly procured M-777 Light Howitzers malfunctioned causing an accident. Ordinance factories must acquire new technology and maintain better hygiene,” Brigadier S Chatterjee (retd) said.Defence Ministry spokesperson, Colonel Aman Anand, did not respond to queries. Unserviceable ammunition isn’t the only concern for the Indian Army, Ordnance Factories have also consistently failed to produce adequate quantity of ammunition.“The present state of preparedness has created voids due to the limited production capacity of the Ordinance Factory and consistent slippage in production targets,” the Indian Army told a Parliamentary oversight committee on defence last year.Informing the Ministry of Defence and Parliamentary oversight committee, the Indian Army wrote, “Out of 22 items indented on Ordinance Factory Boards, as part of the Ammunition road map, 14 items were not supplied at all.”The Indian Army also asked for the accountability to be fixed on the Ordnance Factory Boards for “poor quality,” slippages” and delays in supply of ammunition.",0

The ministry has asked for a report for implementation of transfer policy for rotation of officials working in sensitive regions to enable vigilance directorate to put the information for the perusal of higher officials.“It is reiterated that all concerned may examine the feasibility of transferring the officials working on sensitive posts at the earliest and ensure that no incumbent dealing with sensitive work continues on any sensitive post beyond the stipulated period as advised to zonal railways from time to time,” said the directive issued by railways.This comes after the Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) issued a directive in August this year reiterating that all government departments should ensure rotational policy on sensitive posts. It further said that analysis of frauds in public sector banks and other organisations show that one of the reasons for such frauds was non-implementation of the rotation policy.             The CVC had asked that all departments strictly follow rotational transfer policy and heads of all departments should ensure implementation of the policy.In 2015, Member of Parliament N F Patole had complained to the railway’s ministry about some officials occupying sensitive posts for over 15-20 years and creating hurdles in the transparent functioning of various departments. Patole also said that about 150 officials were posted at various levels in the Railway Board for over 15-20 years.",1
663,"From white jalebis to INS Vikrant, Naik’s memoir has it allIn a political career spanning over five decades, governor Ram Naik faced several interesting incidents that form a part of his memoir ‘Charaivati-Charaivati’ (Marching ahead, marching ahead) written in Marathi and now translated into Hindi, English, Urdu and Gujarati, which will be released by President Pranab Mukherjee at the Rashtrapati Bhawan in New Delhi on November 9.In Lucknow, his memoir would be released on November 11 in the presence of Union home minister Rajnath Singh and chief minister Akhilesh Yadav.In his labour of love, Naik has included interesting things he had to deal with right from rechristening Bombay to ‘Mumbai,’ use of edible colours in sweetmeats, preservation of INS Vikrant and even finding the Constitution of India written in Hindi on gold leaves!“As an MP, I was required to handle a plethora of diverse matters. One of them was prohibiting sweetmeat makers from using edible colours in their products. Union health minister AR Antulay was among my acquaintances. The makers argued that it would be more reasonable to order them to use only permitted food colours of specified quality. However, if the ban was implemented in toto, there would only be white sweets. Imagine eating white jalebis and pedhas,” said Naik.From sweetmeats to INS Vikrant, Naik quickly changes track and recalls how the INS Vikrant was declared a national monument but it had to be disposed off as a scrap due to the failure of Maharashtra and Central government in preserving the warship that helped India win the 1971 war against Pakistan.Recalling another interesting anecdote, the governor said how his initiative led to Bombay being rechristened as ‘Mumbai.’ And a simple query about the Hindi manuscript of the Constitution of India in the Parliament Library literally led him to the ‘golden book.’“While I was reading in the Parliament Library, I came across the original English edition of the Constitution. Curious, I asked to see the original Hindi edition of the Constitution. Quite an amusing tale unfolded from this simple query. The original Hindi edition was written down by Vasant Vaidya, a Maharashtra calligraphist. Gold plated pages were imported from Germany and a special kind of ink, used for writing this edition, was brought from a reputed firm in China. The writing instrument was a special pen, crafted by the famous Watkins Company, made in Washington State, USA. It had taken Vaidya a full year to complete the writing of the Constitution on the gold plated pages. The Hindi edition is decorated with sketches of Lord Shri Ram, Shri Krishna, Gautam Buddha, Rani of Jhansi and several personalities from our cultural and historic past.”Changing tracks once again, Naik while referring to his tenure as chairman of the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) says, “One of the major assignments of the PAC is to investigate in case of any dubious transaction made by various government agencies after they are recorded by the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG). I created a record by submitting eight reports of PAC in one year. The most sensational of these reports was about the misuse of official aircraft belonging to railway ministry by the then railway minister CK Jaffer Sharief.

One has to be sensitive towards them,” Rana tweeted after he was allotted an upper berth in Suhaildev Express on Sunday night.He posted a series of tweets to express his anguish.“Hum AIIMS me admit hone ke liye jaa rahe hain, 3 passengers me se 2 senior citizens hain, uske bawjood hume upper berth allot ki gayi...Kya senior citizens ko yahi facility milni chahiye?’ Rana tweeted tagging the railway ministry and railway minister Piyush Goel.In his second tweet, he also posted his PNR number and berth details.Rana said thankfully a co-passenger offered his own berth to make their journey comfortable.He was travelling with two other passengers – Munawwar Jafri, 68, and Adil Rasheed, 52 – on PNR number 2726069792 and boarded the train from Lucknow in AC-II.“Railways has to be more sensitive towards senior citizens. All three of us were given upper berth making a sheer mockery of our age,” said Rana.“We were clueless as to how to climb up the berth as our knees are not much supportive,” he said, adding it was insensitive on the part of railways which compelled them to plead for berths from co-passengers.“It’s not our age and stature to beg for berth. What do titles like ‘Saraswati Putra’ mean for us when railways don’t even have the courtesy to respect our age,” he said.Read moreSummer heat can be dangerous for the elderly. 6 tips to protect them65-year-old in Mumbai cheated of Rs17.67 lakh in insurance fraudChief public relations officer, Northern Railways (NR), Nitin Chowdhary said: “Berth allocation system is programmed in a manner to give priority to senior citizens and female passengers in allocation of lower berths. However, once the lower berths get reserved, there is no choice but to allocate upper berths.”“As per the allocation system in AC-II, there is a provision to allocate only three lower berths on first come, first serve basis.

665,"Govt mulls pvt role in rly, scrapping of fare subsidyScrapping the railway board, merging the rail budget with the main budget and withdrawing the passenger fare subsidy are among the radical reform proposals the government is considering, official sources said.Railways minister DV Sadananda Gowda is also contemplating a role for private stakeholders in policy-making and lateral entry for IAS officers into the top rail hierarchy to “de-centralise and corporatize” the functioning of the public transporter, which carries roughly 23 million passengers daily.“The railways served the nation well in the initial decades after Independence, but its administrative and institutional structure and functioning seems archaic and unscientific in the present context and needs overhaul. These tasks are huge and difficult and will need to be attempted progressively,” Rail Restructuring Committee chairman Bibek Debroy told HT.The committee was set up recently by the Indian Railways to take forward Gowda’s budget announcements on restructuring the rail ministry and railway board.All these reform proposals have been mentioned in the reports of several expert committees.A top government priority is to replace the “outdated and flexible” accounting practices with a professional “corporate accounting” system that can provide scientific data on the profits and losses of rail operations, the sources said.“The railways must eventually work towards… charging passenger fares commensurate with expenses incurred in providing for the cost of travel. But the progressive hike in fares will also have to be matched with better passenger amenities,” Debroy said.Currently, passenger fares are hugely subsidized, resulting in an annual loss of Rs. 25,000 crore in this segment. A proposal to merge the railways’ nine different cadre and provide for a single, unified cadre — to be called the Indian Railway Service — is also part of the surgical operation plan.",1
666,"Green patches, seats at regular intervals increase walkability quotientWhile on the one hand, Delhi has some of the most beautiful and pedestrian-friendly roads such as Sardar Patel Marg or Kasturba Gandhi Marg, it also has stretches such as the one between ISBT Kashmere Gate and Majnu Ka Tilla, where pedestrians are forced to walk on the main roads and risk their lives due to the lack of walkable footpath.Experts say greenery should be maintained round the year to make footpaths walkable. (Amal KS/HT Photo )Mention the word ‘walkability’ and it immediately conjures up an image of a foreign city such as Paris and London — with people walking on wide footpaths adorned with lush green trees and hedges, seats at regular intervals and colourful shops and eateries along the way. But a careful glance at our city will tell you that Delhi doesn’t have to look beyond its territory to understand what the term entails.While on the one hand, Delhi has some of the most beautiful and pedestrian-friendly roads such as Sardar Patel Marg or Kasturba Gandhi Marg with their canopy of trees, broad sideways with well-laid green patches, on the other hand, it also has stretches such as the one between ISBT Kashmere Gate and Majnu Ka Tilla, where pedestrians are forced to walk on the main roads and risk their lives due to the lack of walkable footpath.Elaborating on the issue, architect and urban planner, AGK Menon, said, “A walkable road needs proper planning and integration of greenery, aesthetics, safety and public utility right from the planning stages. But unfortunately, most roads in the city sans the ones in Lutyens’ Delhi lack this. Sometimes, you see a bus stop right in the middle of the footpath, sometimes, there are no trees to provide pedestrians with shade, and at times, the footpaths are dug up.”But then, one might ask, what does greenery have to do with walkability.The connectionA study conducted by the Delhi Traffic Police in 2016 revealed that road accidents in the New Delhi area — which has massive green coverage and continuous walking facilities for pedestrians — was at least 40 per cent lower than the rest of the city. It also showed that pedestrian deaths in accidents in this area were almost 85 per cent lower.The connection between green coverage and road accidents was first established by the government of Mexico City in 2015, which assessed some of the busiest and the most accident-prone stretches, for over a decade and increased the green coverage there. After the project was completed, it was seen that not only were accidents on the stretch controlled but also that incidents of road rage among drivers had gone down.In a statement released to the local media, the Mexico City government had said the green cover “had acted as a stress buster for drivers” who were otherwise more aggressive on roads. This, they said, became a boon for pedestrians, who had also found the newly developed area more accessible.“Greenery along sideways and footpaths not just provides shade and increases your convenience while walking, it also soothes your senses and keeps you happy and calm. The moment you start walking with your senses feeling the surrounding, it slows you down and acts as a recreation for you. The hedges along edges of footpaths keep you from getting down on the roads, thereby bringing down the chances of accidents,” said KT Ravindran, urban designer and former chairman of the Delhi Urban Art Commission.Curbing pollution woesThere are umpteen studies that have revealed how greenery along roads and footpaths could help bring down pollution. A latest study by researchers from the University of Surrey has shown that hedges can bring down vehicular pollution by more than 60 per cent.In 2009, the Indian Road Congress (IRC) had laid down certain guidelines and objectives that need to be followed while selecting plants.“The objectives while selecting a plant species — as laid down in the IRC — are to reduce air and dust pollution, arrest soil erosion, mitigate extreme climatic conditions, reduce noise pollution, among others. But these are hardly followed in plantation drives,” RNS Tyagi, former horticulture director of the Central Public Works Department, said.Experts said a mix-and-match of big canopy trees and hedges are ideal for footpaths. It, in fact, make roads more walkable.“Just like we need woods and greenery, we also need open spaces. Both are important for us. And for this, we need a proper plan. We can’t just go on planting trees just for the sake of greenery,” author and conservationist, Pradip Krishen, said.Moving aheadSo how exactly do we go ahead? Experts said that to integrate greenery with roads so that they could become more walkable should be the primary objective among planners right from the initial stages.“A major criterion while making a city or its roads walkable is to see that the walkbale streets do not end abruptly. They should have some continuity and end in open spaces such as a park,” said Ravindran.Planners also said the more interactive a footpath -- with lots of greenery instead of a mundane looking road with ‘dead’ walls — the more it will increase walkability.“If the road has spaces with greenery, shops and eateries, which a pedestrian can see, walkabilty increases. A dull road with walls blocking your sight reduces the walkability quotient,” Ravindran maintained.But just planting trees and hedges won’t help. Experts said that in an attempt to make roads and footpaths more walkable, greenery should be maintained round the year. Unless maintained, these green stretches could become shady dark places and become unsafe.“Whenever we think of widening a road or coming up with an infrastructure project, the first thing we see is that trees are chopped off. Sometimes, when footpaths are retrofitted, the bases of trees are all concretised despite a National Green Tribunal (NGT) ruling against such practices. Residents should be involved so that greeneries could be maintained more efficiently,” said Kanchi Kohli, legal researcher at Centre for Policy Research.",0

My eight-year-old son played with snow throughout the way.”Groom along with his family treks to Makku Math in Rudraprayag district for his wedding ceremony after roads were blocked due to heavy snow. (HT Photo)A wedding ceremony with only 25 people is rare in Uttarakhand, but one such wedding took place on Friday at Makku Math in Rudraprayag after the groom along with his relatives walked for over 6km in heavy snow to attend the ceremony.Around 80 people had left for from Triyuginarayan village in the district to attend Rajnish Kurmachali’s wedding ceremony at Makku Math, but were stuck in traffic after vehicular roads were closed due to snow. The family then decided to send only those people who were needed for the rituals such as the groom’s maternal uncle, sisters and some elderly people. The dolled up family undertook a 6km long unique marriage procession, with children playing in the snow to reach their destination.“We had seen a wedding procession like this in 2002 and now this was the next one. People will talk about this procession and the wedding for years as in both the weddings the groom was an army jawan,” said Ashish Gairola, the groom’s brother.Speaking on whether the journey was difficult for the family, Gairola said, “If you see the pictures then you would question whether they were even feeling cold, forget difficulty. My eight-year-old son played with snow throughout the way.”Since the last seven days, the village has not received power supply, making it difficult for them to carry out daily chores. The groom’s brother added that people have been charging their phone batteries through their cars due to power outage.Bijay Lal, head of Triyuginarayan village said, “Even I had to go to the wedding but were all stuck due to the snow. But those who went enjoyed the whole journey and the wedding took place without any problem.”Mangesh Ghildilyal, district magistrate of Rudraprayag said, ""We received information about this wedding where people had to walk all the way. It is good that they walked, as due to continuous snowfall, there are high chances of accident as cars can skid."" He added that machines have been deployed to clear the snow in the village but due to incessant snowfall the roads are still blocked.",0

In an exclusive interview with HT, Nishant threw light on what makes the show stand out from others, why it’s tough to work in the television industry and more.Actor Nishant Malkani is 31 and portrays the role of a father to three grown up men on TV show Guddan Tumse Na Ho Payega. With no grey hair in sight, the actor is seen as the husband of 20-year-old Guddan who owns the title of India’s youngest mother-in-law. In an exclusive interview with HT, Nishant threw light on what makes the show stand out from others, why it’s tough to work in the television industry and more. Excerpts:Tell us more about the show Guddan Tumse Na Ho Payega.The story is about a man and a woman who meet accidently and go on to tie the knot. Both of them are poles apart. While the woman is around 20 years old, the man is in his mid-thirties. The woman is very innocent and even though she has good intentions, she ends up screwing everything. On the other hand, this man is very mature but is still in love with his first wife. They get married accidently due to unexpected circumstances. This man is the adopted son of the family and ends up being a father to three sons and a father-in-law to their wives. So when he marries Guddan, she ends up becoming their mother-in-law as well (as told in the show’s tagline – Guddan India ki youngest saas hain).You play a father to three grown up men in the show. Were you not apprehensive about playing such a role?Initially, I was apprehensive but the makers convinced me about the theme of the show. They were not going to give me grey hair or make me look older. They told me how a lot of twists and turns were going to come in the story and that I was not their real father. What’s interesting about this character was that while he is an angry young man in front of everyone, he was a very chilled out and loud person in the company of his former wife. This is a man who will show his anger even when he is in a romantic mood.Taking a time leap is a common trend on Indian TV shows. If the makers take a time leap of 20 years, will you be ready to play a 50-60 year old on screen?I will be apprehensive but it completely depends on why and how they will justify the time leap. If I find it interesting, I will do it and if I won’t, I will step back.How do you bond with your team?We have a very good team, all of us are very good friends. We have a house party at one of the people’s houses on an off day. We bond like college friends when not working.You have also done a few films.My last film was Bezubaan Ishq in 2016. I do have plans to do films but I am committed for 25 days in a month for this show. As long as I am shooting for this one, I won’t be able to take out time for other things. But after that, I will pick up whatever interesting comes my way. It can be anything – a film, a web series or another TV show. Right now, all three platforms are doing so well that as an actor, there is a lot of scope for anyone to grow.What is the major difference between the television industry and Bollywood?In films, you have a bound script, you know the entire graph of the character and his journey from end to finish. In a television show, everything changes every week. The TRPs decide what works and what doesn’t work and what we are going to do with the story. If the character is not working, we change the character, if not the actor. As an actor, one has to be very flexible to adapt all the time. If the show goes on for a year, you have to come on the screen everyday but yet do something different to keep the audience hooked. I believe shooting a film is much easier than a TV show.",0

After a slump in tourism due to the killing of Hizbul Mujahideen commander Burhan Wani in July 2016, it took frequent spells of snow in January this year to bring large number of foreign tourists to Kashmir amid militancy.The good start to the tourist season of 2019 comes after the industry took a downturn in 2018, a year which witnessed military offensive. Over 8.5 lakh tourists including 50,000 foreigners visited the Valley in 2018 as compared to 11 lakh in 2017. Tourism director Nisar Wani said ,“We received 25,095 tourists across Kashmir in January this year, including 2,480 foreigners,” Wani said.The arrival of foreign tourists has seen a surge. The figure was 1,405 in 2016, 1,170 in 2017, 2,369 in 2018 and 2,480 in 2019. Domestic tourists in January 2018 were 49,000. Wani said domestic arrival was affected as national highway closed due to snowfall for 12 days in January. “The highway closure also increased the price of air tickets exponentially. However, we continue to see more tourists. On February 3, 2019, we saw the highest daily arrival of 1,400,” he added.A chance discovery for someTourists enjoy skiing and heli-skiing on the slopes of Gulmarg.Rob, 32, an Australian did not know that there was a place Gulmarg in India. He said he came to know about the ski resort by accident on internet as it was snowing in the area. “I was stunned when I reached here on January 22,” he said. Rob has decided to stay here for a month and do what he likes the most – snowboarding.“I first visited Manali and then stumbled upon this place. I am happy that I did. The experience here has been beyond my imagination. This is the best place for skiing and snowboarding,” said Rob.Rob, an Australian, loves snowboarding and said he discovered about Gulmarg by accident on Internet.

The last day for the ministry and the board to file its responses is May 18.Kumar’s lawyer Pankaj Sinha, himself visually challenged, submitted before a bench headed by Chief Justice Dipak Misra and Justice Sanjiv Khanna that “the differentiation was uncalled for.”The Railways justified the denial of e-ticketing facility, saying the electronic reservation slip could be misused by general public by making false claims of disability.But the court prima-facie found the argument untenable.

673,"Henkel goes vegan to revive beauty businessGerman consumer goods company Henkel announced new hair care formulations and brands on Thursday, seeking to tap into consumer demand for more natural ingredients as it tries to revive sluggish growth in its beauty business.Henkel will relaunch its European shampoo brand Schauma with a “vegan” formula, roll out to more markets its Nature Box line of hair and body care products made from cold-pressed oils and launch a new “free-from” hair dye line called OnlyLove.It will also launch a premium vegan brand for professional hair salons called Authentic Beauty Concept and expand its Pro Nature range of cleaning products to include detergents.The move comes as shoppers become more wary of processed chemical ingredients and seek out natural alternatives.Chief Executive Hans van Bylen told a news conference the products certified as vegan will initially address a niche market, but he sees strong potential and said the move will eventually help the company adjust all of its formulations.“The increasing shift towards a green lifestyle and the strong increase in the number of vegans has driven the growing demand for plant-derived ingredients in beauty products,” said Magda Starula, analyst at market data firm Euromonitor.The world’s biggest cosmetics manufacturer L’Oreal bought vegan beauty product firm Logocos Naturkosmetik last year and it has launched its own vegan range, Botanea, sourced from plants found in India.Unilever has also launched a fast-growing hair and body brand called Love Beauty and Planet, that is certified as vegan and cruelty-free.Henkel said the Schauma brand’s vegan formula will not contain silicones or parabens, while the Authentic Beauty Concept line will include “pure” ingredients.Henkel, the maker of Schwarzkopf shampoo and Persil detergent, made the announcement after warning in January that earnings would fall this year as it steps up investment in brands and digital technology to try to revive growth.The company has underperformed rivals like Procter & Gamble Co (P&G) and Unilever in recent years, with underlying sales in its beauty care business falling 0.7 percent in 2018 and the laundry unit growing just 1.9 percent.Henkel’s beauty care unit saw organic sales growth recover to 1 percent in the fourth quarter, but it still lagged behind adhesives and laundry, which grew 2.1 percent and 2.8 percent respectively in the period.Van Bylen said Henkel plans a global relaunch of its Persil brand, with new “four-chamber” detergent pods key to reviving growth in North America, where it is battling P&G for market share.",0
674,"High court admits plea against RPF personnelThe Bombay high court on Thursday admitted a public interest litigation (PIL) which sought a probe by Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) in an alleged scam run by Railway Police Force (RPF) of booking petty offenders in railway offences and then releasing them on fake bail bonds.Observing that prima facie offence was made out against RPF personnel, a division bench of justice BH Marlapalle and justice UD Salvi admitted the petition.The court has also issued notices to the Ministry of Railway and Ministry of Home, Government of India, asking them to file affidavit explaining their stand towards investigation against RPF officials.Public prosecutor Pandurang Pol submitted an affidavit filed by commissioner of police, Railways, which said that their “investigation revealed that offence was committed by RPF personnel on duty Thane Kurla in 2008-09 by using fake bail bonds and false documents and misappropriating the money collected from commuters after charging them with relevant sections under the Railways Act”.Pol also told the court that a special investigation team was formed to probe the alleged scam.The petition was filed by social activist Samir Zaveri alleging a scam relating to cash bonds issued by the RPF personnel at Kurla railway station in 2008-09.It claimed that certain RPF personnel were releasing persons booked for trespassing on fake cash bail bonds. They then asked the commuters to pay Rs 500 bail bonds each in fake courts staged by them. Track trespassing is an offence under section 147 of the Indian Railway Act.

675,"How an illiterate rickshaw-puller became a mascot for educationAhmed Ali from Assam’s Karimganj district, while pulling his cycle rickshaw one day in the late 1970s, felt miserable at the realization that like him his soon-to-be-born child too will remain illiterate.Ahmed Ali from Assam’s Karimganj district, while pulling his cycle rickshaw one day in the late 1970s, felt miserable at the realization that like him his soon-to-be-born child too will remain illiterate and may have to pull a rickshaw for a living.Hailing from Madhurband village, when Ali, now 82, moved to Karimganj town, about 300 km from Guwahati, he often saw children attending school and getting educated, and sometimes even ferried them to and from their homes to their schools in his rickshaw.The thought of his child not getting proper education hit him so hard that he decided he should do something about it so that poor children of the coming generation, including his own, do not suffer in privation like him.Since then, Ali has gone on to build nine schools and, because of his singular effort, he even found a mention in Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ‘Mann Ki Baat’ radio programme.“I feel it was Allah’s wish and blessings from locals that I could achieve whatever I wanted,” says a humble Ali.“I could not attend school due to poverty. People of my village were poor and it pained me to see the children there were not able to attend schools due to the same reason. I don’t want to see dropouts from poor families any more,” Ali told IANS during a function in Delhi where he was invited as a guest.For establishing the first school, he sold a portion of his land and donated another portion on which the building now stands. The funds for the schools were also arranged by him from his savings, daily earnings and some from charity.“There were some people in the area who supported the cause and helped in whatever way they could,” he said.To ensure there was no fund crisis for the school, he used to pull his rickshaw in the morning and cut wood at night. He sold that wood and used the money to build the school and later to run it.“There was not even a single school in the area. I had this very strong feeling that when my children will be born, they too will not have any school. After the birth of my first child (a boy), the feeling became more strong,” he said.The school, he added, was even more important for girls as “boys get a chance to go out and get an education, but girls do not”.With a firm resolve that he should do something about it, Ali met an education officer, whom he used to ferry in his rickshaw, and with his help, he established a middle school in his village in 1978.“Soon after it was established, I realised that first, we needed a primary school. Until children were educated at the primary level, who will get enrolled in middle school? In 1980, three-LP (Lower Primary) schools were opened,” he said.In all, Ali has opened three lower primary (class I-V) schools, five middle (class VI-VIII) schools and one high school in Madhurband and nearby villages.“Education is an important thing, and everyone should get a chance to get educated. It is a sin for anybody to not be educated,” he said.“Although I may be illiterate, I get respect from people. They now come to seek my blessings. I feel joy when I see that boys and girls from the village have been attending school. This joy inspired me and I never felt tired,” said Ali.“I get satisfaction when girls come and tell me how helpful these schools were for them. Every year, the overall number of girls in schools is higher than boys.”The high school, started in 1990, has 228 students in the current year. Every year, hundreds of students appear for the Class X exams, but they don’t have a place to study further.“I could only manage to make arrangements for students till Class X. They don’t have a place to study Class XI and XII. I need both the government’s approval and funds for setting up the higher-secondary school,” Ali said, in the hope that he will soon accomplish that as well.“There is no nearby college. The nearest college is also 15 km away. I also want to build a college for students, but that will come at a later stage. First we need a junior college (for students passing Class X),” he added.Ali came to limelight in March last year when Prime Minister Modi spoke about him in his monthly “Mann Ki Baat” address.Ali feels proud that the Prime Minister acknowledged his work and he desires to meet Modi.Asked what he will tell Modi, Ali said he wanted all that the schools should be government-recognised so that funds were never an issue. “I will also ask him for a junior college and a college, if possible.”",0
676,"How Kim Jong un went from pariah to guest of honorKim Jong Un’s arrival in Vietnam by train this week for a second meeting with US President Donald Trump may be most remarkable for how normal it’s becoming.Since opening talks with South Korea last year, the once-reclusive North Korean leader has turned into one of the most sought-after guests in Asia. At each stop -- from Beijing to Singapore and now Hanoi -- Kim, 35, is being escorted down red carpets by officials eager to build early ties with the head of one of the world’s last untapped emerging markets.The swing from international pariah to guest of honor is a testament to Kim’s success in wresting power from military chieftains and eliminating rivals since his father died in 2011. It also illustrates his long-held desire to restore an economy drained by decades of famine, state planning and military expansion under his father and grandfather.“If you want to really understand the Kim Jong Un of the present, you have to travel back to his early years,” said Kim Young-hui, who defected from North Korea in 2002 and is now a senior economist at the Korea Development Bank’s Inter-Korean Economic Cooperation Research Unit.He wondered why his father, Kim Jong Il, hadn’t traveled overseas much “and why North Korea was so poor,” she said, citing a book by a Japanese chef who worked for the late dictator. “Kim Jong Un was thinking that when he became the leader, he would run the country a lot better than his reclusive father.”Over the past seven years, the Swiss-educated Kim has steered North Korea from his father’s “military first” policy focused on building a nuclear arsenal to one that emphasizes the economy. After successfully testing an intercontinental ballistic missile in 2017, he declared the weapons program “complete,” initiated talks with Trump and announced a new strategy for boosting the economy.The move ended Trump’s threats of war and paved the way for a historic first meeting with the US president in June. It also opened a new world of potential investors from Seoul to Singapore -- provided Kim can get Trump to relax international sanctions against his weapons program.Trump played down expectations that he might quickly ease pressure on North Korea, telling US governors gathered at the White House on Sunday: “I’m not pushing for speed, but we’re not removing the sanctions.”In recent months, Kim has railed against the sanctions, which do everything from ban travel by officials to curb its energy imports. North Korea ranks as one of the world’s poorest countries and the sanctions are believed to have helped cause the country’s deepest recession in two decades in 2017, according to South Korean estimates.“When they come to negotiations, it means they are having a tough time internally due to sanctions and Kim feels nervous,” said Thae Yong-ho, who was North Korea’s deputy ambassador to the UK before defecting in 2016 and becoming a critic of the regime.Kim left Pyongyang on Saturday afternoon on a train that will take him through China down to Vietnam. He traveled abroad five times last year -- more than any North Korean leader in at least two decades -- often visiting industrial sites. Kim reportedly plans to do the same in Vietnam ahead of the planned summit, giving him a close-up view of a fellow socialist state that has prospered after easing hostility with the US.North Korean officials have been spotted near Samsung Electronics Co.’s smartphone plants in Vietnam, the Yonhap News Agency reported last week, suggesting Kim may tour South Korean factories. While South Korea is Vietnam’s second-largest trading partner, a North Korean leader hasn’t visited Vietnam since Kim’s grandfather, Kim Il Sung, in 1964.Trump himself has repeatedly cited Kim’s development goals while arguing why North Korea would trade its nuclear arsenal away.“Chairman Kim realizes, perhaps better than anyone else, that without nuclear weapons, his country could fast become one of the great economic powers anywhere in the World,” Trump tweeted on Sunday. “Because of its location and people (and him), it has more potential for rapid growth than any other nation!”Kim hasn’t secured his control over North Korea by showing weakness. His reign has been marked by ruthless purges and executions, including the killing of his uncle and one-time deputy, Jang Song Thaek, as well as the murder of his older half-brother, Kim Jong Nam.That consolidation of power has given him the space to introduce economic and government reforms once seen as nearly impossible in the insular, one-party state. And it’s allowed him to shake hands with Trump, the leader of a country that North Korean propaganda has spent generations blaming for all of its problems.Even now, the purges appear to be continuing. Kim exiled, imprisoned or executed 50 to 70 members of the country’s political elite last year, including opponents of engagement with the US, according to a report published last week by the North Korea Strategy Center, a Seoul-based research institution founded by a former defector.“Kim Jong Un has been very skillful in rewarding the friendly, co-opting the neutral and punishing the hostile,” said Moon Chung-in, special adviser on foreign policy to South Korean President Moon Jae-in, said in an interview earlier this month. “His longevity is institutionally guaranteed. But at the same time he’s good at consolidating power.”Kim now needs to show the elite back in Pyongyang that his engagement efforts can bring economic opportunity without sacrificing the country’s nuclear deterrent -- its “treasured sword.” The regime has a long history of coming to the bargaining table dangling the prospect of cooperation, only to renege on deals after extracting economic concessions.Chun Yungwoo, former chief South Korean envoy to international nuclear negotiations with North Korea, said Kim’s successful consolidation of power requires him to consider what kind of country he wants to rule over for the next 40 to 50 years.“He wants to have a more prosperous country -- he wants economic development,” Chun said. “Without giving up nuclear weapons, all he can do is maintain a subsistence-level economy.”",0
677,"How railways put men at 11 level crossings a day Indian railways did away with at least 11 of its thousands of unmanned level crossings every day during the past 10 months to eliminate these death traps. The last such crossing on broad-gauge lines was converted into a gated one in Allahabad on Thursday, the same day railway minister Piyush Goyal confirmed in his budget speech that these unmanned crossings were a thing of the past. According to railway ministry officials, an accident on April 16, 2018 involving a school van at such a crossing on Kaptanganj-Thawe section in UP that claimed 13 lives was the turning point for putting the focus on quickly doing away with these crossings. “The ministry had told the Parliament these crossings would be a thing of past by March 2020. But work on a war footing was undertaken to complete the task earlier after the accident,” said an official. The number of accidents at unmanned level crossings has been at an all-time low at only three during this fiscal as compared to 65 in 2009-10. Sources said in most of the cases either mechanised or manual system of operating gates have been operationalised to stop vehicles from crossing the tracks when trains go past these spots. They added at some crossing, they have route relay interlocking system where the rail traffic flow is highe Officials said the railways had zeroed down on four models to eliminate the crossings including merger with another level crossing by constructing diversion road, construction of subway or rail under bridge and manning. The last option was found to be most cost effective and less time taking. Building rail under and over bridges often require land acquisition and other permissions.",1
678,"Huawei says Mate X’s India launch depends on 5G availability, no plans for 4G?variantPowered by the company’s Kirin 980 processor, the Huawei Mate X comes with a 6.6-inch dual display panel and offers a FullView display.Dashing hopes of Indian consumers willing to acquire the just-released foldable phone from Huawei any time soon, the company says it is not planning to bring a 4G version of the Mate X shortly and that its availability will depend on the 5G network in the country.Although India is targeting 2020 for 5G roll-out, the country is yet to allocate 5G spectrum to operators even for 5G trial of use cases.Expensive at 2,299 euros (about Rs 1,85,000), the foldable Mate X is a 5G phone and as the US has been raising security concerns over use of Huawei 5G equipment, the European market could be the first to see the release of the phone.Huawei showcased the foldable phone at Mobile World Congress (MWC), Barcelona, on Sunday, but did not allow the visiting journalists to touch the device.“We expect to start shipping the device form the middle of this year through the carrier channel. Making the device available in the open market may take some time,” Kevin Ho, President of the Handset Business, Huawei Consumer Business Group, told IANS here.Replying to a question about producing foldable phone for the 4G network, he said that although the company was not focusing on bringing a 4G to suit markets like India, it could consider such a proposal at a later stage.Powered by the company’s Kirin 980 processor, the Huawei Mate X comes with a 6.6-inch dual display panel and offers a FullView display.It houses massive 4,500 mAH dual battery and several industry-first features, including a new superfast charging capability that can reach 85 per cent battery in just 30 minutes.The phone features a flexible OLED panel and a falcon wing mechanical hinge.“Creating the foldable phone’s hinge is the most challenging part for our engineers,” Ho said. “We had to design the hinge to avoid layers like formation that one gets when one folds a book or a notebook. This was a big challenge and they had to use a sophisticated technology,” he added.While Ho asserted that the phone was ready for mass production, he acknowledged that the company was still doing several tests and was also in talks with app developers so that apps can be optimised for a foldable device.The 8GB + 512 GB phone, which can be easily unfolded at the click of a button, now has only one colour, Interstellar Blue, and comes with a full protection case. Huawei said it might introduce new colours for the device at a later stage.When unfolded, the 6.6-inch dual display panel transforms into an 8-inch tablet only 5.4mm thick.While unveiling the device on Sunday at a packed hall here, Huawei Consumer Business Group CEO Richard Yu claimed that the phone offers best selfie camera. But the company did not reveal the camera specifications.“The phone will provide users more privacy and security protection,” he said.“Today, many carriers are using NSA (non-standalone) architecture, working together with 4G. But the future of 5G is SA (standalone) architecture.“Mate X is the only phone now with the capability to work in both the architecture. So this phone is not only for today, but also for future 5G,” Yu noted.Ho parried questions on security concerns raised by countries like the US which accuse Huawei of passing on data to the Chinese government.“We don’t want to talk about it today. We want to focus on technology and our new products today,” he said.",0

No casualty was reported.The crash happened barely 15 minutes after it took off from Gorakhpur air base along with two other Jaguars for routine exercise.Panic-stricked locals rushed to the site of the burning wreckage in large numbers, Kushinagar district magistrate Anil Kumar said.An eyewitness said they saw the aircraft explode in flames in the sky before hitting the ground with a bang while the pilot landed in a sandy area close to the river bed.“Two other such planes continued to hover in sky when the aircraft crashed. The strong winds intensified the flames of the burning plane and soon it was reduced to ashes,” said another eyewitness.On being informed by locals, police and administration officials, including DM Kumar and senior superintendent of police (SSP) Rajeev Mishra, rushed to the accident site with rescue teams and fire tenders, while an air force chopper airlifted the injured pilot to Gorakhpur airbase where he was admitted for treatment of minor injuries on his back.While the cause of the crash is not known, a court of inquiry has been ordered by Gorakhpur air force officials.Speaking on phone, wing commander Prayagraj air force station, Arvind Sinha, said: “An inquiry has been ordered to look in to the reason of the mishap.”The district magistrate said “the pilot showed courage and presence of mind by diverting the plane away from populated area towards the Chhoti Gandak river but it crashed midway in a field after catching fire. He saved his life by jumping off the plane when it was just about 150 metres from the crash site. He is fine and undergoing treatment at Gorakhpur air force hospital”.",0

681,"Illegal shrines derail centre’s multi-modal terminal project in VaranasiThe National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government’s plan to set up a so-called multi-modal terminal which provides rail, road and waterways connectivity in Varanasi , Uttar Pradesh has run into trouble because of places of worship that have been illegally constructed on the land meant for the project.“Land has been an issue in this project. There are certain sensitivities; there are three mosques and four temples on the railway land on which we want to build the terminal,” a senior official at the ministry of road transport said requesting anonymity. This person added that the ministry doesn’t want to push things on this front because demolishing places of worship could become a contentious issue ahead of the next year’s parliamentary polls.The proposed terminal at Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s constituency is part of the Jal Marg Vikas Project (JMVP, a Rs 5,369 crore World Bank aided project on the Ganga, aimed at augmenting the navigational capacity of the Varanasi to Haldia stretch of the river, to enable commercial navigation of at least 1500-2000 ton vessels).The land in question belongs to the Railways which leased it out to National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) for construction of a bus and a railway terminal.“This is railways’ land and has been given to the NHAI on an ‘as is where is’ basis and they were to further develop that land. The issue is that on some of the land there are mosques and temples. They are unable to find a way to remove them. So i don’t think that project will be able to go forward,” a senior official at ministry of railway said on condition for anonymity.The government had awarded the contract to AFCONS Infrastructure for the construction of phase I of the Multi-Modal Terminal at Varanasi for Rs 170 crore.“ Railways land is usually very old, this one must be around 150 years old hence we don’t know when or how these structures were built they assume that they have been built in the last 20 years. The land is around 100 acres big. We had handed over the rights of the land to NHAI about two months ago,” the railways official said.The Detailed Project Report (DPR) of the construction of the project was prepared by NHAI. It involved building a multi-modal terminal including a railway station and a bus terminal. The land is situated at Kashi station in Varanasi. “There is no easy solution to such sensitive issues. The basic issue is that before construction has to happen it is important to remove these places of worship. NHAI has asked the civil administration to look into it but they also have their own compulsion since this happens to be a sensitive religious issue,” the railway ministry official added.The project has been caught up in land related issues since its inception. Another piece of land near the proposed water terminal couldn’t be acquired initially.“We had some issues which were finally sorted out. There was a group of ‘Hindu Mahants’ who had ownership of the land and they argued that they would not vacate this till the government gave them another plot in the same area, which also was disputed. Officials and state had to get involved to resolve it,” a senior official at the ministry of shipping said.Union minister for road transport, highways and shipping Nitin Gadkari laid the foundation stone for the terminal at Varanasi in August, 2016. The ministry is now considering changing its plans. “There are many land related issues in this project. There was also a small patch of land which was allotted and leased to some trust and now the trust claims to own the land. There are issues with some religious structures. So we are looking at whether it is feasible to overcome this or adjust the entire layout of the multi-modal hub, “ the road ministry official said.Under JMVP, three multi-modal terminals are being constructed at Varanasi, Sahibganj and Haldia. The total financial progress for the project at the end of 2017-18 was ~678.85 crore or 13.05%. JMVP is scheduled to be completed by December, 2022.According to officials at the ministry of shipping and the IWAI, the government is keen to get the water terminal inaugurated by PM in November. According to IWAI, nearly 85% of the work has been completed for the water terminal. The agency added that all issues related to land have been addressed. “The project construction is going on schedule without any hindrances,” IWAI said.",1

683,"In Gorakhpur rally, PM Modi set the tone for Lok Sabha poll battle in PurvanchalPrime Minister Narendra Modi has set the pitch for a fierce poll battle in Purvanchal region (east UP) with the announcement of the launch of Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN) as well as Rs 10,000-crore development projects for the region on Sunday.Aware of the importance of 31 Lok Sabha seats of east UP that will be crucial in regaining power at the Centre, Modi said the NDA government had launched several development and welfare schemes to give thrust to development in the region.“The projects will pave way for development of Purvanchal that remained neglected under the Congress, Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) and the Samajwadi Party (SP) governments,” he said.The prestige of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) will be at stake as its top leaders, including PM Narendra Modi, Kalraj Mishra, Manoj Sinha, Varun Gandhi, Mahendra Nath Pandey and UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath come from this region.In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the BJP had swept this region by grabbing all the seats except Azamgarh that went into the SP’s kitty. The Congress won two while the BSP failed to open its account.As the BJP plans to bag maximum seats from the region, various development and welfare schemes have been announced during public meetings in PM’s Lok Sabha constituency Varanasi, located on the southern tip of Purvanchal, and Gorakhpur that is located in the north.With the SP-BSP combine and the Congress also shifting their focus on Purvanchal, the BJP is going all out to win maximum support from the region.The SP-BSP alliance has shared equal number of seats in Purvanchal to give a tough fight to BJP.Once a strong fort of alliance partners, the BJP made inroads into their vote base in the 2014 Lok Sabha election.SP leader Shivram Yadav said, “Riding on Dalit-Backwards-Muslim formula, the alliance hopes to check the BJP.”The Congress has appointed Priyanka Gandhi Vadra as its general secretary for east UP. The region had played a major role in the formation of UPA government in 2004 and 2009 Lok Sabha elections.In 2014, Congress was wiped out in Purvanchal which was its stronghold since Independence.Congress has also appointed three secretaries – Zubair Khan, Kumar Ashish and Bajirao Khade – to assist Priyanka in the battle of ballot. The party plans to win over upper castes, Dalits and Muslims that were its traditional vote base.That the BJP is concerned over the SP-BSP alliance as well as Congress’s Purvanchal plan can be gauged from the fact that during their address both the PM as well as the CM highlighted the government’s development schemes and attacked the opposition parties.Modi said the BJP government strengthened health facilities in the region, restarted fertiliser factory, electrified rail routes, started manufacturing of railway engine in Varanasi and Gorakhpur to pave way for prosperity in the area.Political analyst AK Mishra said, “To retain the BJP’s hold on Purvanchal region, Modi launched PM-KISAN Scheme in Gorakhpur. Purvanchal region is the agriculture hub of the state and the support of farmers will play a decisive role in elections. The SP-BSP alliance is working on caste equations to win the election while Congress is depending on the magic of Priyanka Gandhi. Besides YogiModi charisma, BJP is playing Purvanchal development card to win the election.”",0
684,"In the next 3-4 years, all trains will run fast and on time’Manish Anand , said that his ministry would soon move the Union Cabinet for approval of “government-to-government” partnerships with foreign countries, a step beyond the concept of foreign direct investment.We saw big-ticket FDI investment in the railway workshop projects at Madhepura and Mahraura in Bihar to the tune of Rs 40,000 crore. What would be the next big FDI investment in the railways We have seen massive interest from a number of countries in the modernisation of our railway stations. South Korea has already submitted its model of redevelopment of the New Delhi railway station. South Korea is ready with a proposal to invest as much as Rs 8,000 crore in the modernisation of the New Delhi railway station. The model is with us, which will be a complete gamechanger as far as a railway station is seen. France is keen to redevelop the Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus in Mumbai. The French are also working for the re-development of Ludhiana station. In the coming times, we will see major FDI inflow into the railway sector.You have been to Germany, France, Japan and many other countries. The railways appear to have become India’s engagement with foreign countries. What can we expect from these countries in the railways We are soon going to the Union Cabinet for approval to enter into “government-to-government” (G-G) investment (agreements). We are ready to sign agreements with as many as 14 countries. They are ready to partner with Indian Railways to make their governments partners in the progress of the railways. Among the 14 countries are Japan, China, Germany, Czechoslovakia, South Korea, France and the United Arab Emirates. G-G investment is better than FDI for the railways because here we do not have to worry about the involvement of private players. The money will come from the government of the partner country. In the coming years, we are going to witness massive G-G investment in the railways. Japan alone is going to invest close to $25 billion in Indian Railways, besides the bullet train project.After commissioning the semi-high-speed rail between New Delhi and Agra, what progress can we expect on speeding up the railways We are going to offer one semi-high-speed route each to the 14 countries with which we are soon going to operationalise the G-G investment model. These countries will build the infrastructure and Indian Railways will integrate them into the existing system. Thus, we can have a large number of semi-high-speed rail networks getting commissioned at the same time; this can change the very face of the railways and the country in the next four to five years.We already are holding trials of the Spanish semi-high-speed Talgo trains. It’s a matter of a few weeks in which we will know the full details of the claims being made by Talgo. Once we get the details, we will take the next course of action.The Bibek Debroy Committee on the restructuring of the Railway Board was constituted soon after the Narendra Modi government came to power. Many more committees have in the past submitted reports. What is being done about their reports So far we have already implemented almost 90 per cent of the recommendations of the Bibek Debroy Committee. We have constituted two cross-functional directorates for non-tariff revenue and mobility, which will directly report to the chairman, Railway Board. We have already delegated powers to the general managers and divisional railway managers. Soon we will sign a memorandum of understanding with the zonal railways in which we will ensure their functional autonomy. Thus, much of the desired outcomes of the various committees have been implemented so far, and much more will be done. Very soon we are also going to establish the rail tariff authority. We are currently examining the legislative and non-legislative components of the proposed authority.In the beginning of the coming to power of the Modi government, we heard much talk about the lateral entry of professionals in government departments. Is the idea still alive We are soon going to induct 100 interns from outside the railways who would become part of the organisation. We are keen to take outside professionals, and the cross-functional directorates would look to benefit from their talent pool.With a soft loan from Japan in place for the bullet train project between Ahmedabad and Mumbai, the popular perception persists that such investment should have come in for existing railway infrastructure. There is a place for a five-star hotel in an economy and similarly a bullet train project too is important for the country. In our economy we have five-star hotels where we do not expect the common man to go. We are not going to invest anything in the bullet train project. The money is coming from Japan. But we will gain from the induction of technology, the safety standards, the capacity to execute big-ticket projects, besides the huge spin-off effect on the economy by spending such a huge sum of money in the country.When are we going to see the fruits of the investment being made in capacity augmentation by the railways, which has been the priority of your two projects In the last financial year we commissioned 2,828 km of new lines, broad gauge conversion and doubling. In the next two years we will add almost 7,000 km of such lines. We are going to invest close to Rs 45,000 crore in the next two years for such projects. By 2019, we hope to commission the twin dedicated freight corridors between Dadri and JNPT, Mumbai and Ludhiana-Kolkata. With their commissioning, much of the tracks will be available for running of trains and will also allow us to time-table the goods trains. In the next three to four years trains will not only run on time, but fast and tickets would also be available on demand",1

688,"Indian Railways And Facilities Provided To The PublicIn the entire world, Indian railways has gained the position of being the largest public system of passengers transport. About 7500 trains for passengers are run by Indian railways carrying 12 million people on an average every day. The first train was run in 1853 from Mumbai’s Victoria Terminals to Thane. A British engineer Robert Maitland Brereton was responsible for the expansion of railways from the year 1857 onwards. Indian Railways is world’s seventh largest utility employer with over 1,376 million employees. As for rolling stock Indian Railways holds over 2,45,267 freights wagons, 66,392 passenger coaches and 10,499 locomotives and runs 12,617 passenger trains and 7421 freight trains daily. Indian Railways earn about 70 per cent of its revenues from freight traffic so majority of its profits come from freight and this makes up for losses on passengers fares low it cross-subsidises the loss making passenger traffic with the profit making freight traffic. However its share in freight traffic is much lower than road traffic. This should be looked into and rational approach for fixing fares for goods trains and passenger trains. Railways has two UNESCO world heritage sites namely the Chatrapari Shivaji Terminus and the mountain railways of India. But, this huge organisation is running in losses of Rs. 30, 000 crores in the passenger segment for the year ending March 2014. As in the practise of railway ministry, new railway line projects are announced during the railway budget each year, without securing additional funding for them. In the last 12 years 99 new line projects worth Rs. 60,000 crores were announced out of which only one project is complete till date while four projects that are as old as 30 years, but are still not complete. This practise of announcing new railway line projects needs a serious approach and should not be announced without proper sanction of budget is there. The passenger facilities like waiting rooms and retiring rooms, needs a serious and practical approach. The passenger associations and railway employees must be consulted on regular basis. Often there are no proper electricity connections for charging mobile phones and they are over crowded. Most of the major railway stations have these waiting rooms, but one cannot be sure of their presence in all stations across India. Retiring rooms are there in larger and important railway stations. Retiring rooms can be basic rooms or dormitory or suits. But these retiring or waiting rooms lack recommended amenities. The railway ministry must pay attention to them rather than to announce new railway line, which may not come without provision of funding.",1

A release from ISMA said: ""As on 15th February, 2019, 507 sugarNSE 14.71 % mills in the country have produced 219.30 lakh tonnes of sugar, as compared to 203.55 lakh tonnes produced by 494 mills on the corresponding date last year. Higher production this year is mainly because Maharashtra and Karnataka sugar mills started their crushing earlier this year. Overall, the country is expected to produce less sugar this season as compared to last season."" According to ISMA, in Maharashtra, sugar production till 15th February 2019 was 82.98 lakh tonnes, compared with 74.74 lakh tonnes produced last year same period. In the current 2018-19 SS, 6 mills have closed their crushing operations in the State while 187 sugar mills are operating, as against 183 mills operated last year on the corresponding date. Due to early start of mills in Maharashtra, the mills therein are expected to close earlier than last year, especially when the sugar production from Maharashtra will be less than last year. In U.P. 117 sugar mills are in operation and they have produced 63.93 lakh tonnes of sugar till 15th February 2019, compared with 64.54 lakh tonnes produced by 119 mills on the corresponding date of last year. The sugar recovery achieved this season is about 0.77% more than what was achieved so far during the last season, but the yield per hectare is lower than last year, because of which the total production in U.P. will be less than last year.In case of Karnataka, till 15th February, 2019, mills have produced 38.74 lakh tonnes of sugar, 10 mills have closed their operations in the State while 57 mills are in operation. During the corresponding period last year, 52 mills had produced 30.73 lakh tonnes sugar. In case of Tamil Nadu, 33 sugar mills are in operation and have produced 3.50 lakh tonnes of sugar, as compared to 2.90 lakh tonnes produced by 28 sugar mills in 2017-18 SS on the corresponding date. Gujarat has produced 7.78 lakh tonnes of sugar till 15th February 2019 with 16 sugar mills in operation. Last year, 17 sugar mills were in operation and they had produced 7.25 lakh tonnes of sugar on the same date. In Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, 24 sugar mills have produced 4.50 lakh tonnes as on 15th February 2019, as compared to 4.60 lakh tonnes produced by 23 sugar mills on the corresponding date last season. In Bihar, Uttarakhand, Punjab, Haryana and Madhya Pradesh & Chhattisgarh, sugar production till 15th February 2019 has been in the order of 4.90 lakh tonnes,2.15 lakh tonnes, 3.75 lakh tonnes, 3.60 lakh tonnes and 3.20 lakh tonnes, respectively.

At least 200 have been injured.Sources said the probe team was also looking into allegations that the two loco pilots — Janak Sharma and Pramesh Purohit — were drunk at the time of the accident. Sharma, Purohit and train guard Ajay Srivastava appeared before the inquiry panel headed by rail safety (eastern railways) commissioner PK Acharya on Tuesday to record their statements. “Blood samples of the pilots were taken and sent for medical examination. The report hasn’t come yet,” said Acharya.The panel summoned 41 railway employees of different departments in Jhansi railway division for their written statement. Some people, mostly passengers, also came to record their statements.The panel will record statements of people and railway personnel for two days but the period can be extended. The inquiry report will be submitted within a month to the Railways ministry.Railway men mostly stuck to the version that there was no problem with the train. Gate man Ravindra Paswan, who was at gate no 197 at the time of the mishap, said in his deposition before the panel that the train was moving at normal speed and there was no issue with it.However, Ishwar Dass, another railway employee, said when the train passed his point at 3.01am, it left the overhead wires dangling, indicating that it was running at high speed.

692,"International Conference On Decarbonization Of Indian Railways- Mission Electrification Begins TodayMinistry of Railways through Institution of Railways Electrical Engineer (IREE) in partnership with ASSOCHAM India is organising the International Conference on Decarbonization of Indian Railways- Mission Electrification today. Member Traction, Railway Board Ashwani Kumar Kapoor briefed about this conference and gave following information:-An International Conference on “Decarbonization of Indian Railways – Mission Electrification” is being organized in New Delhi on 3rd Nov.’16.The Conference aims at bringing various stakeholders on a common platform for exchange of ideas and to deliberate on implementable technological solutions and financing options to significantly increase pace of electrification and achieve the target for setting up of renewable energy installations with total capacity of 1000MW by 2020.The Conference will also project Indian Railways as an attractive investment destination considering its plans for huge investment in next 5 years towards modernization of its electrified network and use of renewable energy.The Conference shall cover aspects relating to policy, technological modernization, mechanization, innovations and financing models for railway electrification and de-carbonization. National Transport Development Policy Committee (NTDPC), in its report, has identified electrification of railway tracks as a means to reduce fuel consumption. The report has recommended for taking up electrification on priority through systematically tackling the bottlenecks in progress of electrification projects. It has also suggested that electrification should be viewed as a means of making rail transport independent of imported fossil energy, while also provide a choice in sourcing energy. Moreover, electric traction allows regeneration of power while braking/coasting and feeding the network, thereby reducing overall consumption of energy and carbon emissions. In this regard, following action has been planned for improving efficiency and bringing in cost economies in freight and passenger operations. Reducing the Carbon Foot prints through use of sustainable and green sources of energy is also a key focus area.In line with this vision, following action plan has been planned: Electrification of Railway TracksCurrently 28,000 rkm of tracks are electrified (42% of the total network) carrying around two-thirds of total freight traffic and 50% of total passenger traffic. As against 800 kms of average electrification in the earlier years, 1600 rkm of railway tracks were electrified in 2015-16. To fast track the pace of electrification, Ministry of Railway would be involving PSUs like IRCON, RITES and PGCIL. Increase in the pace of electrification will reduce its fuel bill by Rs. 10,000 cr. annually as against the business as usual approach. Harnessing Renewable Energy on IR to reduce energy cost and carbon footprints Indian Railways targets to harness 1 GW solar and 500 MW wind power as announced in Rail Budget 2015-’16, 500 MW of solar units on roof tops through Central Finance Assistance (CFA) from MNRE and balance 500 MW on land.",1

694,"Is it curtains for Congress' Bansal?One could hear a pin drop at former railway minister and Congress candidate Pawan Bansal's residence at Sector 28 on Friday afternoon, as it became clear that the Chandigarh MP for the last three times in a row will lose the seat. As it later transpired, he lost by 69,642 votes, the highest-ever for the city, polling 1,21, 720 votes.The day started as usual for him as he rose even before sunrise, at around 5:30am. A quick shower and prayer followed by a cup of tea was what it took for him to be ready to accept the people's verdict, and as the day wore on, he looked increasingly downcast. The handful of supporters that had gathered before counting began also dwindled away as the trends that showed him trailing trickled in.So, as Bansal with wife Madhu visited the counting centre at around 9:30am and was back in half an hour, the writing was on the wall and the deserted Congress office in Sector 35 said it all.It is clear that the Railgate, the infighting within the party, the anti-incumbency against the UPA, the nation-wide Modi wave and the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) factors combined led to the defeat of the four-time parliamentarian.With the Congress suffering a humiliating defeat across the country and Bansal losing, in what was his bastion, is it curtains on the political career of the veteran political leader?Bansal, who had held important positions in the UPA-1 and UPA-11 including the parliamentary affairs ministry and the railway ministry, will be without any work now as HT brings you the reasons for the loss.Less than expected votes from coloniesAs more than half of the 6.13 lakh voters were from colonies and villages and the turnout here had always been high, Bansal had expected a sizeable number of votes. He probably failed to hold ground here against the Modi wave. The BJP's focus on highlighting the Railgate, where his nephew was caught by the CBI accepting `90 lakh for a posting, when he was the railway minister, probably influenced the voters. AAP candidate Gul Panag also took away some of these votes.",1

698,"Kangana Ranaut attacks Manikarnika co-director Krish after NTR biopic’s failure, says time to question ‘every vulture’Kangana Ranaut has criticised Manikarnika co-director Krrish as his NTR biopic failed to perform at the box office, saying ‘now is the time to question every vulture who was out for my blood’.Actor Kangana Ranaut has constantly been in headlines for her film Manikarnika: The Queen of Jhansi which eventually entered the Rs 100 crore club at the domestic box office. Earlier, co-director Krish had accused the actor of hijacking the film and a bitter exchange of words had followed the film’s release. Krish had reportedly left Manikarnika to direct the NTR biopic titled NTR Mahanayakudu, which failed at the box office.This has now given the actor one more reason to criticise the filmmaker. On being asked about the same, Kangana told Pinkvilla, “Yes, I also read about zero recovery of NTR, it’s called black mark on the actor’s career. My heart goes out to Balakrishna sir who trusted Krish and put so much at stake, but for me now is the time to question every vulture who was out for my blood, who attacked and harassed me for taking charge of a troubled situation and making a critically acclaimed and commercially successful film (Manikarnika), but what is shameful is that Krish and some paid media ran a sabotage campaign against a martyr’s biopic. Honestly, I am embarrassed of them, our freedom fighters gave blood for some thankless fools.”The actor was part of several controversies and had accused Bollywood celebrities of not supporting her during the film’s release. It seems she has finally found support in senior actors including Anupam Kher and Paresh Rawal who have slammed people on social media for making fun of a behind-the-scene video featuring Kangana on a mechanical horse during the shooting of battle scenes for Manikarnika.While her sister Rangoli had spoken up in her defence and justified how an actor’s close-up is shot just like all Bollywood and Hollywood films, now Paresh Rawal and Anupam Kher have come out in her support.Paresh Rawal took to Twitter to justify Rangoli’s stand and sharing how scenes are shot with the help of special effects. He tweeted, “According to these dimwits and pinheads they believe that superman and Batman in Hollywood films are actually flying and it’s not some camera trick or CG effects ...!”Anupam had earlier called out a user for criticising Kangana for not using a real horse to shoot some battle scenes. He had tweeted, “How much venom this man has against a self made actress #KanganaRanaut!! This is called ‘acting’ idiot. Actors all over the world do that. That is their job. She will be remembered for decades for her hard work in movies. While you got your fifteen minute fame by using her name.”Earlier, co-director Krish had accused the actor of hijacking the film and a bitter exchange of words had followed the film’s release. Kangana had earlier called out Alia Bhatt and Aamir Khan for not supporting her films, claiming she always does the same for others. Kangana said while she attended the screenings of Dangal, Secret Superstar and Raazi, Alia and Aamir did not return the favour.According to a report in Pinkvilla, Kangana said she made a phonecall to Alia and told her to ‘grow a spine’. She said, “I suggested that she (Alia) grows some spine and support an important film about woman empowerment and nationalism....if she doesn’t have a voice of her own and her existence is all about being KJo (Karan Johar) puppet then I don’t consider her successful... I told her if she is only focusing on earning bucks and not raise a voice, then her success has no value.... hope she understands the true meaning of success and her responsibilities, Napo gang life is simply restricted to give and take favours hope she rises above that.”",0

The excluded professionals include doctors, engineers, lawyers, chartered accountants and architects registered with professional bodies, the agriculture ministry said in the operational guidelines for the Pradhan Mantri KIsan SAmman Nidhi (PM-KISAN) scheme announced in the interim budget on February 1. The government will not cover those with a monthly pension of Rs 10,000 or more. The scheme promises to pay Rs 6,000 a year in three instalments to farmers who own up to 2 hectares of land, with the first instalment due for the period from December 1 to March 31. States have been given a deadline of February 25 to submit lists of eligible farmers. The cut-off date for eligible farmers is February 1 of this year, after which new owners of agricultural land won’t be considered for the next five years. “However, benefit will be allowed in those cases where transfer of ownership of cultivable land takes place on account of succession due to death of the landowner,” according to a document on the website of the Department of Agriculture Cooperation & Farmers Welfare. An alternative mechanism will be set up for the northeast, where land ownership is often community based, making it difficult to select eligible famers. The mechanism for eligibility of northeast farmers will be developed and approved by a committee of Union ministers from the Ministry of Development of North East Region (DoNER), Ministry of Land Resources, Agriculture Minister and the state chief ministers or their ministerial representative, based on the proposal by the northeast states concerned. The Centre has asked the states to identify and designate a sponsoring bank for this scheme. “States may consider designating the same bank being used for transfer of fund for MNRGES as sponsoring bank for this scheme,” it said. It said the designated bank should have well-developed IT systems with the capabilities of integration with the web portal of the scheme and Public FinancialManagement System (PFMS).",0

Sharma counts himself as one of them.“The Trans bill is the single biggest mistake of the [ruling] BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party],” he said. “If it is passed, it will make life very difficult for us.” The bill, however, was not taken up by the Rajya Sabha during the final session of Parliament.Sharma, who identifies as a transman, cannot get a voter ID card made, because, in a conundrum that is peculiar to the transgender community, he does not have “proof” of his gender identity. The two identifying documents that he possesses, the Aadhaar card and PAN (Permanent Account Number) card, are in the female gender he was assigned at birth. “I am not making a voter ID card right now because I know that it will be difficult to change the gender and name on it. First I’ll get my Aadhaar and PAN card corrected, and then I’ll get all these made.” Does he know what needs to be done? “Yes, main aapko batata hoon (let me tell you about it),” he said, narrating the procedure. When will he do it? Soon, he replies.",0
705,"Lok Sabha elections 2019: BJP to go it alone in HaryanaThe Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) would go it alone in Haryana in the forthcoming Lok Sabha elections, party’s co-incharge for parliamentary polls in the state, Vishwas Sarang, said.Sarang, who was in Kurukshetra on Saturday to attend a workshop of party workers from Kurukshetra, Karnal, Ambala and Sonepat Lok Sabha constituencies, said the decision about party candidates would be taken by the party’s central leadership after discussion with state leaders.Exuding confidence that the BJP would win all the 10 Lok Sabha seats in Haryana, Sarang said the results of Jind assembly byelection had proved that opposition parties, especially the Congress, had lost ground in the state.He, however, parried question on why the BJP had not taken action against Kurukshetra MP Raj Kumar Saini, who has formed a separate party.Earlier, addressing party workers in the Kurukshetra University’s auditorium, chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar said Prime Minister Narendra Modi will address 11 crore party workers in the country on February 28. BJP’S national president Amit Shah would hold a meeting of party workers at Hisar on February 25 and on March 2, a bike rally would be taken out in every assembly constituency of the state, he said.Without taking any name, Khattar alleged that many Congress leaders were facing corruption cases. “Leaders alone cannot be blamed for corruption. Government officers and employees also play an equal role,” he added.“But we have managed to eliminate corruption, ”the CM said.Khattar and BJP’S Haryana in-charge Anil Jain also launched a mobile app of ‘Digital BJP Haryana’ on the occasion.",0
706,"Maha-­Metro faces land acquisition hurdles in old Pune or ‘peth’ areasMaharashtra Metro Rail Corporation Ltd (Maha-Metro) is facing opposition from residents in the old Pune or ‘peth’ areas for acquiring land for construction of Metro stations at Budhwar peth and Mandai.Maha-Metro had already identified 322 entities whose properties will need to be acquired in these areas for carrying out the construction work. Brijesh Dixit, managing director, Maha-Metro said, “It is natural to face opposition for land acquisition. No one is willing to give their property. However, the government needs to acquire the lands to complete the projects in the larger interest.”Dixit said there are 205 Metros working in the world and all of them face similar problems when it comes to land acquisition. However, Maha-Metro is planning to give “good compensation” to the project affected people and is keeping all options open such as giving cash component or alternate property at another location, and TDR (transfer of development rights) for handing over the properties.“This is a crowed area and Maha-Metro will need these properties for erecting the metro stations. The metro corridors will not need land acquisition,” he said.The affected properties have been surveyed by Maha-Metro with the help of third party as well its project officials. The authorities have also assured to rehabilitate the affected people in the same locality. PMC has one plot in the city area which can be developed and all the affected families can be rehabilitated in the same locality, he said.Dixit said Maha Metro will ensure that no injustice would be done to anyone during the land acquisition process.Railway ministry gives approvalAfter defence ministry, the railway ministry has given its approval for crossings over railway lines on the Pune Metro route and connectivity with Khadki, Shivajinagar and Pune stations.Brijesh Dixit, managing director, maharashtra metro rail corporation said, “Pune is lucky as it is getting speedy permissions for the Metro project. After the defence ministry’s recent nod to hand over 10 acres land at Khadki, Dapodi and Range Hills, the railway ministry has given its approval for crossing the railway lines near Kamgar Putala and connecting of metro stations with railway stations at Khadki, Shivajinagar and Pune Railway station.The defence ministry has cleared the Pune Metro right of way permission as also the land transfer proposal for Metro stations,” he said.The Maha Metro’s Pimpri-Chinchwad to Swargate Metro corridor is passing from the Khadki Cantonment area for which defence land is required for parking and construction of railway stations at Khadki, Dapodi and at Range Hills. Land is also required from the defence ministry for erecting the metro corridor of 1.3 km from Khadki to Range Hills. Maha Metro had submitted its proposal to the defence ministry six months ago and was continuously following it up. With the clearances having arrived, the work on the metro corridor will now be speeded up, he said.",1

708,"Major intersections in Delhi death traps for pedestriansMajor intersections in Delhi are turning into death traps for pedestrians. With the rising number of vehicles and a lack of infrastructure for at-grade (at the surface level) crossings, the number of deaths involving pedestrians continues its steep rise every year.According to Delhi Police estimates, of the 1,604 people killed in road accidents last year, around 40% were pedestrians.(Picture for representation)Major intersections in Delhi are turning into death traps for pedestrians. With the rising number of vehicles and a lack of infrastructure for at-grade (at the surface level) crossings, the number of deaths involving pedestrians continues its steep rise every year. According to Delhi Police estimates, of the 1,604 people killed in road accidents last year, around 40% were pedestrians.The task of crossing at intersectionsCrossing busy intersections is an uphill task most pedestrians face on a regular basis. The art of racing to the other side of the road in a fraction of a second before the signal turns red for one section, and green for the other, is something that Delhiites have mastered over the years.An estimate by the Indian Road Congress (IRC) shows an average pedestrian in Delhi takes around seven to eight minutes to cross a busy intersection from end-to-end.This is because the signal timings often ignore those who mean to reach their final destination. After crossing each carriageway, pedestrians have to make a pit-stop for at least two minutes on dividers before they get to cross again. With proper infrastructure, this time can be reduced to three minutes, road safety experts said.They maintained that at intersections, signal timings should be adjusted with the average time taken by a pedestrian to cross the intersection from one end to the other kept in mind. Any breaks will only result in people jumping in front of vehicles off-turn and ending up risking their lives.Sahil Kumar, a bank employee working in Rohini’s Sector 18, said that during the peak morning traffic, he often has to wave at vehicles to slow down so that he can cross the road.“Most drivers end up hurling abuse at you for suddenly jumping on the road, waving your hand like a traffic police officer. But what option do we have? Waiting for these vehicles to stop will mean waiting for at least 15-20 minutes,” Kumar said. He added that the installation of pedestrian signals will give people like him some breather.“We constantly have drives to educate and fine drivers who stop their vehicles beyond the stop line, eating up on the zebra crossing for pedestrians. Safe roads are everyone’s right,” said joint commissioner of police (traffic) Alok Kumar. He also said that regular meetings are conducted with the road-owning agencies to come up with newer ways to make safe walking spaces for pedestrians.A study conducted by the IRC in 2016 proved that the presence of pedestrian signals on busy roads made people feel safer and decreased fatalities. It also showed pedestrians were willing to wait longer at such signals because of an assurance of safe passage when the lights go green.Lack of pedestrian infrastructureIn a 2013 study by Geetam Tiwari from Indian Institute of Technology (Delhi), the pattern of road accidents across major cities in the country over a span of five years was analysed, and it was confirmed that in the national capital, pedestrian deaths comprised at least 47% of all fatalities — the second highest in India after Mumbai.The reason for this alarming trend can be seen in the way the city’s roads are being designed. Despite studies proving pedestrian tendencies to cross the road at-grade, road-owning agencies are doing little to facilitate safe road crossing and walking facilities for them. The priority is on vehicles, which are the centre of the way the city’s roads are planned, experts said.Tiwari said India has been upgrading its highways with dividers, four- and six-lane roads and expressways since 2000. Yet, deaths due to road accidents continue to rise by 9%-10% each year.“The design completely ignores the requirements of walkers, bicyclists, two-wheeler users, even animal carts and other slow-moving traffic. We need to relook our car-centric road designs,” she said.As cities expand, so does vehicular traffic, but all emphasis is on ensuring better movement for cars, and so “cities are becoming hostile to pedestrians,” she said.Sample this. At the crossing outside the gates of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) on Sri Aurobindo Marg, despite the high pedestrian footfall of patients and their caretakers, there aren’t many avenues for people to cross over to the other side of the road safely, without having to wait endlessly.At the pedestrian signal at the gate, the lack of police presence sucks out any deterrence for speeding vehicles to give way to those looking to cross the road, and the apathy of road-owning agencies can be seen in the barely visible zebra crossing. Experts said that for government agencies, on most roads the only road-crossing facility is a gap between the grilles, through which a person or two can squeeze in.The solutionsTiwari said public spaces will improve if road designs move beyond the car-centric approach. “We need to change the way we design our roads and ensure better enforcement of rules,” she said. Experts stress the need to streamline the road geometry, bring the stop-line closer and make the intersection compact. “This will reduce the distance pedestrians have to walk and give them a sense of direction. We often find wide intersections that pedestrians are unable to cross in one go,” Amit Bhatt, director integrated transport, WRI India, maintained.Table-top crossings at slip roads can bring down the speed of vehicles and provide a smooth crossing facility to pedestrians. “Pedestrians prefer to cross at-grade. A majority of intersections are not well-designed. It is important that we factor in their requirements while redesigning our intersections. There is a need to provide refuge islands wherever possible,” Bhatt said.Also, government awareness programmes on road safety over the last 40 years have made little dent in improving road safety. The world over, research shows that individual behaviour cannot be changed without changing the physical environment in which traffic operates, and ensuring better enforcement of rules.The disadvantaged section of senior citizens and differently abled must be catered to. In most developed countries, provisions of pelican signals are made for the benefit of senior citizens, school children and differently abled, who can turn the pedestrian lights green to cross roads safely",0

They robbed him of his phone, smartwatch and wallet and forced him to withdraw money from ATM. (Shutterstock)Trying to help out an accident victim came at a high price for 24-year-old Rishabh Mandal who was duped, robbed of his valuables, and held captive for over two hours on Friday night.According to Mandal, he was on his way home in Patel Nagar, Delhi, when the incident occurred, near the Noida City Centre Metro station.“I got off an auto-rickshaw around 8pm at the service lane near the Metro station, when a man in his mid twenties approached me. He said his younger sister had met with an accident and was trapped in a car, and said he needed my help to pull her out of the car. I accompanied him to a street nearby to help him out,” Mandal, who is preparing for competitive exams, said.He said they were followed by another person, which was when he realised something was amiss.“The person who was following us asked what was going on. That’s when the tone of the man who asked for my help changed. I realised something was amiss and tried to leave. However, a third person blocked me from behind. One of them pulled out a gun and another held a knife to my throat. They took my phone, smartwatch and wallet. I didn’t have much cash on me so they asked me to withdraw money from any ATM. When I told them that I didn’t have money in the account, they asked me to arrange it and threatened me with dire consequences if I did not comply,” Mandal said.He said a couple of passersby were around. “But I was so scared that I could not approach them and anyone passing by would not have guessed what was going on. I called my elder brother for help. When he didn’t take the call, I called my younger brother and asked him to transfer money to my account,” he said, adding that the accused also suggested several excuses he could give his brother to encourage him to transfer the money.“I withdrew Rs 5,000, which he transferred to me and handed it over. They didn’t come into the ATM kiosk with me for fear of getting captured in the CCTV camera. When they realised that I was scared and was complying with their demands, they got greedier. They took my phone and asked my brother to send more money. They took nearly Rs 28,000 in multiple transactions,” he said.Mandal alleged that he tried to flee but the accused held him captive. “They were manhandling me the whole time and abusing me. They even threatened to kill me. Finally, around 10.10pm, when one of them was on his phone and the other two were talking, I decided to flee. They followed me, but I came upon a wedding party where I asked a few people for help. They gave me Rs 100 and dropped me at the Golf Course Metro station from where I came back home and filed an e-FIR,” said Mandal.Based on his complaint, a case of robbery (Section 392) under the Indian Penal Code was registered at the Sector 24 police station.“An investigation is ongoing in the case, and we will nab the accused soon,” Mithlesh Updhyay, station house officer, Sector 24 police station, said.",0

Gauri Mahadik (32), all set to join the Officers' Training Academy (OTA) at Chennai, said instead of just mourning her husband's death, she wanted to pay a befitting tribute to him by wearing his stars and uniform. Major Mahadik, who had joined the Army in 2012 and commissioned in the 7th Battalion of Bihar Regiment, died in the fire at his camp in Tawang near the Indo-China border in in December 2017. Post-completion of 49-week training at the OTA, Gauri Mahadik, a qualified company secretary and law graduate who recently topped the Service Selection Board (SSB) exam in the widow category, will be inducted into the Army as a Lieutenant by March 2020. ""After my husband's death, I was thinking what to do next...I thought I can not just sit and cry. So I decided that I should do something for him and make him proud. ""I decided to follow his footsteps and with a determination that I will wear his stars and uniform, started preparing for SSB examination,"" said Mahadik while talking to PTI from Virar, a distant suburb of Mumbai, over the phone.

718,"Ministry of Railways plans upgradation of 90 stations ahead of next general electionsModernised railway stations is something Indians have been long promised but it remains a pipe dream. Hopes were raised, yet again, in February when Finance Minister Arun Jaitley announced that 600 railway stations across the country had been picked for modernisation. All a part of the whopping Rs 1.48 trillion allocation to the railways - the highest ever for the sector - in the Modi government's last Budget before the next general elections.But then one remembered that a year earlier, then Railway Minister Suresh Prabhu had launched the first phase of what the ministry called the ""World's largest Station Redevelopment Program"", comprising 23 major railway stations. The idea was to redevelop the stations through the public-private-partnership (PPP) model, where the railways will provide approximately 140 acres of encroachment free land to the developers on a 45 year lease and hence the project would generally be cost neutral to the Railways. Moreover, according to a statement from the ministry at the time, the Rs 1 lakh crore program would benefit more than 100 cities and 16 million passengers per day across the country.Things did not quite pan out that way due to muted private investor interest. Undeterred, the Railways recently came out with a list of 68 stations earmarked for a facelift through its own resources before the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. The cost is pegged at Rs 5,000 crore. ""We can't wait for private investors anymore. We'll redevelop these stations on our own and could monetise them later through commercial exploitation,"" a top rail ministry official earlier told The Economic Times.The new list includes some of the busiest stations in the country like the Old Delhi railway station, Guwahati, Howrah, Patna, Allahabad, Udaipur, Haridwar, Pune, Bengaluru, Ambala, Chennai Egmore and Bhubaneshwar.The redevelopment plan has reportedly been assigned to the zonal railways with a one year deadline for completion. According to the daily, all the shortlisted railway stations will get state-of-the-art amenities, including elevators, swanky waiting room, a modern passenger announcement system, new platforms, shopping complex and airport-like entry and exit. The redevelopment will be closely monitored by the general managers of the respective zones and the divisional railway managers.""While doing this (redevelopment), efforts would be made to showcase local culture or history to reflect in the station facade. For instance Aurangabad station is to be developed on lines of Ajantha or Ellora, Agra station is to be developed on lines of Taj Mahal, Ujjain station is to be developed on lines of Mahakaleshwar temples,"" the ministry said in a statement in March.Apart from the 68 stations announced by the Railways, the redevelopment of the Habibganj railway station in Madhya Pradesh and the Gandhinagar railway station in Gujarat are already racing towards completion and seem on course to meet the December 2018 and January 2019 deadlines, respectively.These two stations have hogged the headlines of late given the impressive list of features they will pack. In case you missed the buzz, the Habibganj station will have a large waiting area comprising over 600 benches with neat and clean toilets and commercial hubs. Of the total Rs 450 crore allocated for the redevelopment of the Habibganj railway station, Rs 100 will be spent on improving the infrastructure, while the rest of the amount will be spent on building glass structures and facilities for food, entertainment, and the waiting area. The Indian Railway Stations Development Corporation Ltd. (IRSDC) is also working on other ideas like installing video game zones and virtual museums to make the station more passenger-friendly and commercially viable.The Gandhinagar railway station, scheduled to be inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi before the Vibrant Gujarat Summit in January 2019, is a special purpose vehicle (SPV) between the IRSDC and the Gujarat government. Around Rs 250 crore have been allocated for its redevelopment and the centre of attraction here will be a 300-room 5-star hotel built 22 metres above the ground, while the railway track will pass underneath it.

It is famous for its natural heritage that is the home for several wildlife animals, including 43 tigers, 15 panthers and around 1800 wild dogs.With an area of 625.40 sq km, the project includes Tadoba National, created in 1955 with an area of 116.55 sq km and Andhari wildlife sanctuary, created in 1986 with an area of 508.85 kms.It said that the tiger conservation in Tadoba national park was commendable for the last one and half decades. The tiger population has been increasing, though slowly, during the period. Population of the big cat in the area was 36 in 1994 census which has now increased by 43 in the last census.In view of its good track record, the Ministry of Environment and Forests also included the tiger reserve in its pilot project for mapping wildlife sanctuaries and parks by the Wildlife Institute of India, Dehradun. Rs 1.39-crore was sanctioned for the pilot project that would be completed in 36 months. Out of the five sites selected for this pilot project, three were tiger reserves - Tadoba-Andhari, Dudhwa and Corbett. The identified targets included generation of satellite data and securing the survey of India topographic maps.Talking to Hindustan Times, B Majumder, the PCCF (wildlife), and Maharashtra state said that by providing mobile and landline network, the park would certainly be able to benefit the tourists and forest personnel who are working there for wildlife conservation. “We are expecting more tourists after starting this facility,” he further claimed and informed that the BSNL was exploring to provide such facility in the locality.Meanwhile, the MTDC with the help of ministry and Railway and the ministry of Tourism is planning to start an exclusive narrow gauge vintage train from Nagpur to Nagbhir (near Tadoba) for tourists, an answer to the to Nagbhir (near Tadoba) for tourists, an answer to the Palace of Wheels in Rajasthan. The plan, which was postponed because of numerous reasons, would begin from January next.",1

722,"More MPs likely to quit parties in key Brexit weekThe prospect of more MPs quitting Conservative and Labour parties hung heavy over Westminster as Prime Minister Theresa May braced for a key week in parliament with a little over a month to go for the UK to leave the European Union on March 29.Labour deputy leader Tom Watson admitted on Sunday the party had to change to ensure more MPs do not take the extreme step of resigning, while May’s cabinet was under strain to maintain collective responsibility with three ministers openly, and others covertly, toeing new lines.Three cabinet ministers - business secretary Greg Clark, justice secretary David Gauke and works and pensions secretary Amber Rudd have already favoured extension to Article 50 to delay Brexit beyond March 29.May has been cautioned by senior advisors that she cannot sack ministers who vote this week to delay Brexit without causing a further rupture within her party, given the growing number of ministers and MPs reportedly in favour of delaying it.May used a party convention in Oxford to reiterate her position that has led to much hand-wringing inside and outside her party, as well as in Brussels: “Our focus to deliver Brexit must be absolute”.“We must not, and I will not, frustrate what was the largest democratic exercise in this country’s history. In the very final stages of this process, the worst thing we could do is lose our focus,” she said.As the newly-formed The Independent Group attracted funds from small and major donors worth “tens of thousands of pounds”, as former Labour MP Chuka Umunna put it, he called upon the British public to join the formation for a new kind of politics.He wrote in the Sunday Mirror: “This week we have come together in the national interest, to say ‘enough is enough’. We have each put everything on the line to give something new a try. Believe me, it wasn’t an easy decision for any of us”.“We don’t yet know the destination where the path we’ve taken will lead us. But what me and my Independent Group colleagues are absolutely clear about is that we cannot and must not recreate the old parties with their tribalism and incompetence”.",0
723,"More Staff For Railway Protection Force In Kashmir After Pulwama AttackThe Railway Protection Force (RPF) has increased the number of its personnel in Kashmir following the terror attack in Pulwama to ensure the safety of train passengers and to protect railway property, a senior official of the force said.A total of 40 CRPF personnel were killed and five injured on February 14 in a terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir when a Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammad suicide bomber rammed a vehicle carrying over 100 kg of explosives into their bus in Pulwama district.""We had a meeting with the Ministry of Home Affairs yesterday where the decision was taken to increase the presence of RPF in the region,"" said RPF DG Arun Kumar.""The chairman railway board also had a detailed security briefing with all zonal and divisional RPF officers on the security of railways. It was decided that a company of RPF will be sent to Kashmir for additional security,"" he said.While four companies of the RPF are stationed in Kashmir, one more, with 125 personnel, will be airlifted from Jammu to the area, he added.",1
724,"MoS Railways dubs Railway Protection Force as 'toothless', demands more power for it Dubbing the RPF as a ""toothless"" organisation, Minister of State for Railways Manoj Sinha on Wednesday strongly pitched for more powers for it even as his senior ministerial colleague Piyush Goyal played down his concerns, asserting that regardless of a law they should move on with their work Goyal also said an amendment to the existing Railways Act was only a ""technicality"", and urged the Railway Protection Force (RPF) and the Government Railway Police (GRP) to work together to secure railways and passengers. Speaking at a conference on security of railways, both Sinha and RPF Director General Arun Kumar pushed for handing over the registration, enquiry and detection of passenger-related crimes on board running trains to the force. Currently, even if a crime is detected by the RPF, the case has to be handed over to the GRP for further enquiry. RPF is a toothless organisation. It is involved in security, but has no powers. Despite ability and efforts, the RPF has not got the powers it deserves. However, it is blamed for everything that happens on railway premises. But the reality is that other than taking care (of railway property), RPF has no real powers. An amendment in the law, I personally feel, is the need of the hour,"" Sinha said However, Goyal asserted that ""whether the law is changed or not, whether the GRP does it or the RPF, these are all technicalities. We have to decide that we need to work together to secure passengers. Then law will not come in the way."" The RPF DG also highlighted how his force can leverage its inherent advantage of having an all India jurisdiction to prevent and detect crime in moving trains. Since the jurisdiction of an RPF posts cuts across jurisdiction of many police stations, it has an advantage of identifying place of occurrence, quick registration of the case and subsequent detection, Kumar added. ""Therefore, we may consider empowering RPF to register, investigate and detect passenger luggage thefts so that the state police can concentrate on checking serious crimes like robbery, dacoity, rape, murder and focus its efforts in maintenance of law and order in railway premises. ""A draft bill for amendment in Railways Act to empower RPF to register, enquire and prosecute cases of passenger luggage theft and crime against women has been approved to be sent to the cabinet for further legislative action,"" he said.

725,"MoU Signed For Development Of Railway Infrastructure In TelanganaIn the august presence of Chairman, Railway Board Shri A.K. Mital an Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between Ministry of Railways and State Government of Telangana for “Formation of Joint Venture Companies for Development of Railway Infrastructure in the State of Telangana” has been signed.On the event of Signing Ceremony, Chairman Railway Board Shri A. K. Mital, Member Engineering Shri V. K. Gupta, Member Staff Shri Pradip Kumar, Secretary Railway Board Shri R. K. Verma and other Board Members and Senior Officials were present. On behalf of the Railway Ministry Shri Ved Prakash Dudeja, Executive Director/Works signed the MoU whereas on behalf of Government of Telangana, Shri Sunil Sharma, Principal Secretary, Department of Transport, Roads & Buildings, Govt. of Telangana signed the MoU. Dr. Shashank Goel, Resident Commissioner, Govt. of Telangana was present among others. The MoU was signed in the backdrop of Railway Minister’s Budget announcement regarding setting up of Joint Ventures with States for focused project development, resource mobilization, land acquisition, project implementation and monitoring of critical rail projects.Speaking on the occasion, Chairman Railway Board stated that Railways has a big shelf of projects valuing about 3.5 lakh crore. Last year, Railways had sanctioned additional lines of nine thousand kilometres. There has always been lot of expectations from various States for new railway lines/lands. Thus, to meet the demands of the States, a Cabinet note was got approved for formation of JV Companies. He stated that 17 States have already consented for formation of JV Companies in their respective States and 5 States have already signed MoUs with Railway Ministry in this regard which are Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, Odisha. He stated that today’s MoU will help in putting the execution of railways projects on fast track.  He stated that this will also help to take into account the priorities of the States because these projects will be finalized in consultation with the States as there would be offices from State Governments as well as Railways in the new Company which will be formed.  He stated that this is very welcome step which takes the partnership of State and Centre together to take railway projects on very fast pace. Salient Features of the MoU:-  In view of the growing demands for railway lines in various states and huge requirement of funds to execute them, Minister for Railways announced in his budget speech regarding setting up of Joint Ventures with states for focused project development, resource mobilization, land acquisition, project implementation and monitoring of critical rail projects. 17 State Governments consented for formation of Joint Venture Companies in collaboration with the Ministry of Railways for development of rail infrastructure in their respective States. Draft MoU were sent to these State Governments and discussions were also held with them to clarify various provisions of the MoU.MoUs have already been signed by the Ministry of Railways with the State Governments of Odisha, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Kerala and Chhattisgarh.Today, MoUs are being signed with the State Governments of Telangana. This signing of MOU is going to be a stepping stone for formation of JV companies.The MoU envisages formation of a Joint Venture companies having 51% stakes of the respective State Government and 49% stakes of Ministry of Railways. Thus, the JV companies shall be fully owned by the Government. The companies will primarily identify projects and possible financing avenues in addition to Govt of India and the State Governments. After finances for a project are tied up, project specific SPVs or special purpose vehicles shall be formed. These SPVs can have other stake holders from Industries, Central PSUs, and State PSUs etc. However, the JV companies shall be mandatory stake holders with minimum 26% shares in the SPVs.The ministry of Railways will sign a concession agreement of 30 years with the project SPV for safe and sound operation, revenue sharing and providing technical & marketing logistics to the SPV. The revenue sharing shall be based on already established formula being used for inter zonal apportionment of revenue.The most important aspect of this MoU is that the ownership of the land shall vest with the SPVs which are a departure from previous practice. This will give financial leverage to the company to exploit commercial potential of the land. This is likely to result in making project viable which are otherwise not viable.At the end of concession period, the railways will have option to take over the assets at a nominal price. This is largely in line with average codal life of the assets as most of the assets will need large scale replacement after 30 years.Indian Railways has been playing a major role in national integration by connecting the remotest places and bringing people closer to each other. Railways receive a large number of demands for network expansion as a railway line acts as an engine of growth for the area it serves.However, Railways have a large shelf of ongoing New Line, Gauge Conversion and Doubling projects needing about Rs 3.5 lakh crores to complete. We have been trying to meet the aspirations of public within limited availability of funds.To expedite the projects, Railways have been trying to mobilize resources through other than Gross Budgetary Support. However, on the initiative of Minister for Railways Sh. Suresh Prabhu, Indian Railways have tied up funds for critical capacity enhancement project of doubling, third line, electrification etc. A MoU was signed with LIC of India and we have already taken first tranche of Rs 2000 Cr for these projects. This tied up loan will ensure dedicated and assured funding for such critical projects.Indian Railways have targeted to commission 2000 Km New Lines, 4000 Km Gauge Conversion and 11000 Km Doubling/Tripling/ Quadrupling projects over 5 years i.e. from 2015-16 to 2019-20. In 2015-16, we had kept quite ambitious target of commissioning 2500 Km Broad Gauge track. It is a matter of great satisfaction that we are poised to not only achieve these targets but to surpass them. We have already commissioned about 1300 Km Broad Gauge track till December, 2015 against 800 Km track commissioned in the corresponding period of the previous year (Due to monsoons, major commissioning takes place in the last quarter of the financial year).Formation of Joint Venture Companies with the State Governments will go a long way in faster commissioning of critical rail infrastructure projects as it will not only help in mobilization of funds but also in facilitating various clearances and land acquisition.",1

The handset instead uses light sensors to scan the veins in a user’s hand or to recognise their face.The phone’s front-facing camera, which uses a sensor chip developed by Germany’s Infineon Technologies , can scan in three dimensions - making it more secure than existing biometric methods of unlocking phones such as fingerprints.LG product evangelist David Montanya told a launch event it would be harder to ‘spoof’ than the FaceID feature used in Apple’s iPhone X because the vein structure in a user’s hand has less than one chance in a billion of being the same as anyone else’s.Users can also activate features with gestures - for example to play or pause a song or video, or adjust the volume, by twisting their fingers, emulating the character played by Tom Cruise in science-fiction detective thriller Minority Report.LG did not set release dates or announce prices for the new phones, but said the 5G model should hit stores in the first half of the year.",0
727,"Mumbai rail roko | Highlights: Protest called off, but agitators warn of another stir; train services resumeCommuters in Mumbai travelling on the Central Railway (CR)?struggled on Tuesday, after railway apprentices decided to protest against the railway recruitment system by resorting to rail roko between Matunga and Dadar railway stations on the main line during the morning rush hours.The railways select and appoint apprentices for various technical jobs, to be done in their various workshops across India. Earlier, these apprentices were absorbed into the railways as they got preference during recruitments. However, in 2016, the railway ministry decided to stop this and offer them just a 20% quota. Since then, ,many apprentices have not been able to get railway jobs and have been staging protests.Protesters on Tuesday blocked all the CR?lines, so both the slow and fast local train services ahead of Matunga have been shut completely, forcing commuters to walk on tracks. “Due to some agitation between Matunga and Dadar, rail traffic has been affected between Matunga and CSMT,” said Sunil Udasi, chief public relations officer, CR.The agitation started after 7am, and went on for around three-and-a-half hours.Here are the highlights:11.51am: Protesters head to Bandra (east), likely to meet MNS?chief Raj Thackeray at MIG Club.11.30am: Tracks cleared and trains running.

728,"Mumbai railway train commute is as noisy as an alarm clock ringing constantlyHear this. Your daily train commute on the Mumbai suburban railway is as noisy as an alarm clock ringing constantly, according to a study. While the study revealed that the Western Railway is the noisiest at 119.1 dB — as loud as a steel factory, the Central Railway is quieter, but only marginally, at 91.6dB.Non-governmental organisation (NGO) Awaaz Foundation measured noise using decibel meters from an old train between Bandra station and Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus (CST) on the harbour line, a new train between CST and Thane station and both old and new trains between Churchgate and Virar stations on the western line. While Virar station was the noisiest on the western line, Byculla station and Mahim junction were the noisiest on the harbour and central lines respectively.“Railway noise levels have been a huge source of stress, which has not been recognised up till now. After our readings were made public, complaints have been pouring in about how much it affects their daily life. This is just the beginning and there is a lot more to be done to reduce this source of noise pollution,” said Sumaira Abdulali, convener, Awaaz Foundation. “All types of travel are an integral part of people’s lives. The Centre needs to restrict noise levels on the suburban railways, like it has been done by the Airport Authority of India, which made the Mumbai airport a silent one.”Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) officials said that the readings were a cause for concern and pose a serious threat to people’s lives as they are exposed to such levels daily. “We will be raising the issue with the Union environment ministry and the railway ministry as noise readings close to 120dB is dangerous for even healthy people if they are exposed to it daily,” said D Saha, additional director, CPCB.",1
729,"Mumbai rain: Late trains, traffic snarls, water, scary wall collapse, et al. Mumbai came to a standstill on Monday -- just a few days after the onset of monsoon -- as overnight rains led to the usual chaos of delayed trains, water-logged roads, horrific traffic snarls, and a rather scary wall collapse in a central neighbourhood of the city. Four people have died in the last 24 hours in the city and its suburbs. A 15-year-old died after falling into an open pit in Malad. Another 13-year-old was killed in a wall collapse in thane. Two died yesterday when a tree collapsed on them near Azad Maidan in South Mumbai. A large part of the boundary wall of a plush apartment complex in Wadala collapsed and subsided in the morning, burying nearly a dozen cars. The damaged cars, mostly belonging to residents of the complex -- Lloyds  Estate -- were stuck in debris.Local trains, the city's life line, were running behind schedule as usual, at the hint of the first heavy rains this season. Water-logging was reported from low-lying areas and office-goers and vehicles found it difficult to navigate roads in large parts of the city.  Meanwhile, Mumbai's civic body officials placed pumps on stand-by in neighbourhoods that are prone to water-logging.  The Indian Meteorological Department has said that heavy to very heavy rains are expected to continue.Two people died and five were injured on Sunday after a tree fell on them near Metro Cinema at MG Road in South Mumbai's Marine Lines area, according to news agency ANI.A 13-year-old boy was killed and his parents were injured when an adjacent wall collapsed on their house at Wadol village in Ambernath taluka of Thane around 2:15 am today, the district civic body's regional disaster management cell chief Santosh Kadam told news agency PTI. In another incident, a 65-feet compound wall of a housing complex in Thane city collapsed this morning, crushing two cars and another vehicle, he said.  On Sunday, Mumbai recorded the highest amount of rainfall at 110.80 mm between 8:30 am and 4:30 pm, a Met department official said.",1
730,"Mumbai stampede: Tragedy is fallout of misplaced prioritiesIt is a sad irony. The stampede took place at Elphinstone Road station on the day railway minister Piyush Goyal was to visit Mumbai and get a first-hand experience of the struggle millions of daily commuters face as they commute between work place and home in overcrowded trains. In fact, the railway officials were also considering an event to rename Elphinstone Road station during Goyal’s visit to Mumbai on Friday, but it was somehow put on hold.For the past few years, commuters’ associations and activists have been raising the issue of overcrowded foot overbridges and narrow staircases at Parel and Elphinstone Road stations and warning the authorities that there could be a stampede-like situation here. The Hindustan Times published several reports on the subject. A plan for makeover of the two stations on two different suburban lines (central and western) joined by a narrow foot overbridge was prepared a few years ago. However, typically it was not given priority. On the other hand, a political demand to rename Elphinstone Road station as Prabhadevi was taken up on urgent basis and a notification was issued by the railway ministry in no time.Anybody who takes a glance at the two stations during morning and evening peak hours can tell there is an urgent need to rebuild their basic infrastructure. In fact, not just Parel and Elphinstone Road, but some other stations in central Mumbai have been witnessing similar problems. Following the redevelopment of mill land, in which defunct textile mills gave way to skyscrapers housing commercial offices, central Mumbai’s Parel-Worli belt became a commercial hub. Footfall at these stations saw a massive increase. The railway officials, however, are slow to react to the development and the outcome is there to see.Even the Maharashtra government and Mumbai civic body who gave permission for vertical development of central Mumbai should share the blame for the incident. Both the state and city governments were well aware of the development in the area, but did little to upgrade the infrastructure there.The incident also raises questions over the way the suburban railway network is governed by the railway ministry.The railway ministry is taking up projects such as air-conditioned trains, elevated railway corridors and above all, the Rs1,00,000-crore Mumbai-Ahmedabad bullet train. There could be a case for planning for the future, but what about the need to improve and upgrade basic infrastructure at railway stations? Shouldn’t that be a priority?Experts and commuters’ associations have been demanding there should be a separate cadre to handle the suburban train networks at mega cities like Mumbai, as the top railway officers often fail to understand how the Mumbai suburban section, which is used daily by over 7 million commuters, needs to be run. Maybe, it’s time to consider this demand as well.",1

After the approval, we will start identification of land. Banks will also be approached for loan,” said an MRVC official.With the expansion of the suburban railway network, the railway authorities have clubbed major projects under the umbrella of MUTP-3A. Procurement of 210 AC local trains, elevated corridor between CSMT- Panvel, too, are included in it. The project will increase the operational capacity of the western railway, further segregating suburban and long distance traffic up to Virar. It will also provide east-west connectivity to the extended suburbs of Mumbai.",1

Banks will also be approached for loan,” said an MRVC official.With the expansion of the suburban railway network, the railway authorities have clubbed major projects under the umbrella of MUTP-3A. Procurement of 210 AC local trains, elevated corridor between CSMT- Panvel, too, are included in it. The project will increase the operational capacity of the western railway, further segregating suburban and long distance traffic up to Virar. It will also provide east-west connectivity to the extended suburbs of Mumbai.",1

734,"Mumbai: Railways to evict illegal hawkers from entry and exit points of stations, FOBs In a bid to prevent incidents like the Elphinstone station stampede that claimed 23 lives, the railway administration has undertaken a drive to evict illegal hawkers from the entry and exit points of the station as well as from the foot overbridges to ease commuter movement.Twenty-three persons were killed in the stampede on a foot overbridge (FOB) linking two railways stations in Mumbai on Friday during the deadly rush hour. ""Though action against hawkers is undertaken on a regular basis, from October 1, this drive has been intensified with a combined operation launched by the RPF and GRP, and moreover they will also be patrolling the FoBs,"" said chief spokesperson of the Western Railway Ravinder Bhakar.However, passengers and railway representatives want permanent eviction of hawkers and have warned the railway officials that they would report to the Railways Minister if the hawkers return to do business at these spots.Bhakar said Western Railway administration is soon going to demarcate the railway area to stop this menace forever.He said, ""Most of the complaints against hawkers we receive, fall under the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) area where we do not have our administrative control. So we are blamed unnecessarily. Therefore, we have decided to demarcate our periphery and we will keep full vigil within our jurisdiction.""The Central Railway too has launched a drive against illegal hawkers at several stations including Ghatkopar, Kurla, Byculla, Mulund.Eviction of hawkers paved way for smooth movement of commuters near railway stations and on foot overbridges.Senior PRO of Central Railway A K Jain said, ""Though our security forces, keep driving away unauthorised hawkers, they have been now been asked to deal strictly with them.""Rajiv Singal, who has been a member of Railway Users Consultative Committees in Central Railway and Western Railway, however, dubs this exercise of evicting hawkers as merely an ""eyewash"".Singal said, ""This is simply dressing up and no permanent cure. It is showoff because audit team is doing their job and media pressure is working. I can bet you, hawkers will be back again.""""Until and unless, disciplinary action is not taken against the senior RPF officials in whose jurisdiction hawkers operate, nothing is going to change,"" Singal said.T N Dubey, former member of Divisional Railway Users Consultative Committees in Western Railway, said, ""If hawkers come back, we will write to the Railways Minister and draw his attention to the issue.""

738,"Odisha to implement PM-KISAN; farmers to benefit from central and state schemesChief minister Naveen Patnaik’s government had earlier been noncommittal on the PM’s farm intervention scheme as well.By MEERA MOHANTYBHUBANESHWAR: The Odisha government has agreed to implement the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN), deciding to share the first list of beneficiaries under its own farm-intervention programme for the Centre’s cash-transfer scheme. Chief minister Naveen Patnaik’s government, which had refused to implement the Ayushman Bharat central health insurance scheme, had earlier been noncommittal on the PM’s farm intervention scheme as well. The Centre is expected to formally launch the PM-KISAN scheme, announced in the interim budget 2019-20, at a farmers’ conclave in Gorakhpur in Uttar Pradesh on February 24. The onus on identifying beneficiaries for it has been placed with the states. Preoccupied with a state-wide rollout of its own Krushak Assistance for Livelihood and Income Augmentation (KALIA) scheme — it covers sharecroppers and landless agriculture labour as well — the state government had not decided who would qualify for the central scheme. On Thursday, the state announced it would share the list of 12.45 lakh small and marginal farmers who had received the first instalment of Rs 5,000 under the KALIA scheme. These farmers, holding up to 2 hectares of land, in the state now stand to gain an additional Rs 6,000 in three instalments through the year under the PM-KISAN scheme. Addressing a gathering of farmers at Sohela in Bargarh district, Patnaik on Thursday launched the Phase-II of KALIA. The scheme has been praised by economists for not being a loan waiver and including sharecroppers and landless farmers. Those with landholding get an assistance of Rs 25,000 (over five cropping seasons) while sharecroppers and the landless farmers get Rs 12,500 in three instalments. Patnaik’s said: “It is very sad that the Centre’s scheme does not have anything for these neglected and deprived sections (sharecroppers and landless farmers). I have taken up the issue with the Prime Minister and demanded steps for supporting the landless farmers, sharecroppers and agricultural workers and protecting their interests.” He also wanted the assistance to be enhanced from Rs 6,000 to Rs 10,000. The KALIA juggernaut — with posters, billboards, and conventions sweeping the countryside — has practically the entire state machinery occupied even as Patnaik’s Biju Janata Dal aims for a fifth-term in the government. The government’s latest announcement is KALIA scholarships. The state government, which claims to have already paid 16 lakh farmers, said on Thursday it distributed money to another 14 lakh small and marginal farmers.",0
739,"Opinion |?BJP needs another Modi waveWhat do the most recent state elections tell us about the likely fortunes of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the 2019 national election?The BJP lost the elections in all three of the Hindi belt states that went to the polls in November and December, including two states (Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh) it had controlled for 15 years. This continued a string of weaker-than-expected electoral performances (e.g., Bihar, Gujarat) in states where the BJP had a dominant performance in the 2014 national election.BJP partisans remind us that national elections are very different from state elections and that one should not extrapolate from these results — Modi’s charisma and popularity will loom large in 2019, they argue. Meanwhile, the Opposition sees these results as unmistakeable evidence that the BJP will be greatly weakened in 2019.Political punditry aside, what do state elections really tell us about national elections?It should be clear that state-level voter preferences play a major role even in national elections. Several state-level political parties such as the Trinamool Congress (TMC), the Biju Janata Dal (BJD) or the Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) are likely to win many seats in the Lok Sabha, even though they do not have clearly articulated national agendas. This is a natural consequence of the fact that a party’s capacity to deliver benefits and infrastructure such as roads and schools locally and the strength of the local party organisation are among the most significant determinants of a popularity (even in national elections) — and strong regional parties often perform well on these criteria. At the same time, charismatic leaders such as Indira Gandhi or Narendra Modi, and specific issues or policies like the Ram Janmabhoomi movement or the popularity of the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (NREGS) have helped the BJP or the Congress disproportionately in national elections.In some ways, a party’s performance in Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan is likely to be more predictive of the outcome even in national elections; they also do not have the coalition dynamics of Karnataka or Uttar Pradesh and are largely straight BJP/Congress contests. The BJP won state contests in Chhattisgarh, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh in 2007 and 2008, and also won these states in the 2009 national election, even in the face of a commanding performance by Congress nationally. The BJP won all four states in 2012 and 2013, and swept them in the 2014 national election. Of the 91 parliamentary constituencies (PCs) in these four states, the BJP won an eye-popping 88 seats, a strike rate of 97%. About 31% of all seats the BJP won in 2014 came from just these four states.Data from the Election Commission of India (ECI) allows the analysis of national election results down to state assembly constituency (AC) level.Chart 1 displays the AC-level vote share for the BJP in 2012 and 2013 state elections with the AC-level vote share for the BJP in the 2014 national election. There is clearly strong statistical relationship — state electoral results predict national results. For every 10% increase in AC-level vote share for the BJP in a state election, there is a roughly 5.7% increase in vote share in the 2014 national election. To be sure, the 2014 result was more than a repeat of past state results. It was a wave election, and Narendra Modi had a major effect. In these four states, the BJP had an average vote share of 45% in state elections but an average of 55% in the 2014 national election.This implies a Modi effect — the extra bump to BJP’s vote share in going from state to national elections — of about 10%. This 10% was not distributed uniformly, some areas saw much larger increases than 10% and some areas saw much less.Cut to the present situation. In 2017 and 2018, the average vote share of the BJP in state elections in these four states dropped to 41%. Given the poorer performance in these four states (it retained Gujarat and lost the other three), and the uneven distribution of the Modi effect, how will the BJP perform in 2019?Chart 2 displays the predicted number of seats in these four states in the 2019 national election using a statistical model accounting for the relationship between state and national results and the scale of the Modi effect (and its uneven distribution) — all based on how the 2012 and 2013 state election data predict the 2014 results.If there is a Modi effect at 2014 Modi wave levels, then the BJP can be expected to win about 83 seats in 2019, only five less than in 2014. But if the Modi effect drops to about 5% (that’s still a fairly large effect), then the BJP will only win about 65 out of the 91 seats in these four states.If there is no Modi effect, then the party will win just 37 seats.When combined with a stronger opposition coalition in Uttar Pradesh, the BJP will have a tough time returning to power in such a scenario.The BJP will need to repeat its commanding performance in these four states if it is to win again. No one can really say what will be the electoral impact of the BJP’s announcement of reservations for economically backward classes or the Pulwama attack.But this analysis underscores one simple point. The BJP will have to manufacture another Modi wave if it is to return to power in 2019.",0

See all the photos of JLo and Kareena’s matching looks before you say no.Kareena Kapoor might not have attended the 2019 Oscars. However, photos of the Bollywood actor’s stunning metallic dress from a recent awards function have everyone comparing her sparkly dress to one worn by actor-singer Jennifer Lopez at the 91st Academy Awards in Los Angeles on Monday. JLo might not have been nominated for an Oscar, but she made sure to leave quite the impression on the red carpet, dressed in head-to-toe sparkle, courtesy of fashion designer Tom Ford. For the star-studded occasion, JLo, who also presented an Oscar, teamed her shimmering metallic long-sleeved gown with sleek wavy hair and stunning diamond jewellery. Interestingly, Jennifer Lopez’s Oscars dress looks a lot like Kareena Kapoor’s equally mirrored and sparkling dress by Dubai-based fashion designer, Atelier Zuhra. Take a look JLo and Kareena’s silver dresses that screamed maximalist glamour:While these Jennifer Lopez and Kareena Kapoor dresses bear obvious resemblance to one another — both have mock necks, which elongate their silhouettes — JLo’s shiny floor-length look is (as expected) more red carpet than Kareena’s sleeveless ankle-length dress. JLo’s figure-hugging Tom Ford gown was covered in mosaic mirrored tiles and glistened under the bright lights on the red carpet of Hollywood’s biggest night. Jennifer Lopez added even more shine to her glam by wearing a chunky diamond ring and matching earrings.Kareena Kapoor’s fitted dress, which she wore to the Social Media Summit and Awards 2018 in November, was also decorated with mosaic crystal embellishments, but offered a more fun, party vibe. It featured Atelier Zuhra’s signature shattered mosaic crystal mirrors — inspired by Barcelona’s Gaudí architecture. Another similarity between Kareena and Jennifer’s looks? Their make-up. Both JLo and Kareena wore a dramatic smoky eye to complement their metallic dresses. While, the jury is still out on whether Jennifer Lopez’ Tom Ford gown was inspired by Kareena Kapoor’s Atelier Zuhra design, our guess is not — considering both JLo and Tom Ford don’t need much inspiration to churn out fashion gold (or silver).",0
741,"Pakistan’s house of cards: How its purported aces have been trumpedSome of Pakistan’s purported aces have been trumped by New Delhi over the years, others have been neutralised, and some have outlived their utility. Here are nine cards Pakistan has played against India.By Chidanand RajghattaPakistan has used various “trump” cards over the decades to stalk and stall India’s growth fuelled by being an open, democratic and plural society despite some recent challenges. Some of Pakistan’s purported aces have been trumped by New Delhi over the years, others have been neutralised, and some have outlived their utility. Here are nine cards Pakistan has played against India. The American Card: Used from the time Pakistan was formed when its leaders quickly allied with Washington even as India stumbled into the Soviet orbit. The end of the Cold War, the collapse of the Soviet Union, India’s economic reforms and subsequent growth, the Kargil war, and 9/11 (which had Pakistan’s fingerprints on it) resulted in Pakistan losing this hand. The Afghan Card: Fearful of India’s size and growing heft, Pakistan has long sought “strategic depth” in Afghanistan by installing a friendly, puppet regime in Kabul, a strategy that resulted in the coming to power of Taliban in 1996 (and eventually led to 9/11). But Pakistani overreach built on a Sunni-Wahhabi construct has ruined this card. Except in Taliban pockets, Pakistan is now despised by most Afghans who see it as a malign force. The Kashmir Card: A card the Pakistan military and its elites have played since 1947 to corner resources. Most poor Pakistanis care squat about Kashmir, which is “cash mere” for the Pakistani military as it dips its hand in the till. The Pakistani establishment continues to lie to its own people about UN Resolution (47) on Kashmir (which actually enjoins that Pakistan should first withdraw from the areas it has occupied before other steps). With the passage of time, changes in demographics etc, the resolution, which was non-binding in the first place, is now infructuous. But Pakistan won’t accept it because peace would mean having to whittle down its military budget. The Saudi Card: In this petro dollars-for-nuclear cover deal, the House of Saud has long backed and bankrolled Pakistan, acquiring an outsized influence on its domestic politics to the extent that it is a go-to place for Pakistanis in retirement or exile. But Saudis themselves have embarked on a nuclear quest, and India’s growing influence (it has greater number of workers and white collar workers) means Pakistan’s influence is being reduced down despite Ummah solidarity. As Crown Prince Salman suggested to his hosts last week, when living next to the world’s #3 and #2 economies Pakistan would benefit from peace. The Muslim Ummah Card: Over the years, Pakistan has presented itself as a champion of the Islamic world and has singularly prevented India from acquiring even an observer status in the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), whose associates go beyond the 50-Muslim majority countries in the world (Russia and Thailand for instance have observer status). India, which has the world’s second largest Muslim population after Indonesia, has gradually increased its influence in the the Islamic world (particularly in the Gulf), and a breakthrough is inevitable. But its task will be made difficult if the Hindutva hotheads at home run amuck. The Russia Card: As India has gravitated towards the United States and Pakistan has lost traction in Washington, Islamabad has tried to woo countries such as Russia, Turkey and even Iran in the hope of strengthening its China card. But it is a weak hand. Pakistan is so caught up in domestic radicalisation and internecine bloodletting that few countries have any confidence in its long-term prospects. And despite India’s on-again, off-again ties with these countries, New Delhi interest and influence on account of its economic heft. The China Card (and for China, Pakistan Card): China finds it useful to constrain India using Pakistan. The day India begins to use demographic, economic and cultural clout, the usefulness of this card could diminish. Just think of all the Chinese phones we buy, the general size of the Indian market. China will also not want to import Pakistan’s radicalisation into its sensitive Xinjiang province. The Terrorism Card: Pakistan’s most potent card, an extension of its “death by thousand cut” policy following its defeat in the 1971 war. India’s weaknesses, including in its security doctrine, and global indifference, had enabled Pakistan to export terror (its principal export) and get away, literally, with murder. New Delhi has failed to sensitise world capitals of Pakistani fingerprints on not just terror attacks in India but in many other places across the world. The Nuclear Card: Pakistan’s ultimate trump card that gives cover to its terrorism, one that India failed to take care of between 1971 and 1984 by which time it was too late. The Nuclear Card: Pakistan’s ultimate trump card that gives cover to its terrorism, one that India failed to take care of between 1971 and 1984 by which time it was too late. Remarkably, Pakistan does not have a Pakistan card. The world’s sixth most populous nation has the sixth largest army (and is a nuclear power to boot), but its economy is ranked 24th in size. Maharashtra has a larger economy, and Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Gujarat will each overtake it soon. Nearly Nearly ten times the size of Pakistan’s economy, India is adding one Pakistan to its GDP each year, and will have an economy roughly 40 times larger by 2050. This growing imbalance is actually what makes the Pakistani military reckless in its support of terrorism. New Delhi has only one card – the India card. Playing a cool, calculated, and cohesive hand, while quietly attriting Pakistan, economically and through covert payback, without the hysteria, histrionics and grandstanding currently on display, will yield better results. The Pakistani house of cards will inevitably collapse.",0
742,"Panel wants railway ministry to create body to regulate faresA parliamentary committee wants the railway ministry to create the body it has long promised to, that will, among other things, regulate fares.In its latest report, the Railway Convention Committee of Parliament maintained that since the proposed authority is yet to take a final shape, “consideration of suitable subsidy sharing mechanism is yet to begin.”Parties in power rarely increase passenger fares, irrespective of the carrier’s financial health , given the political ramifications of such a move. The idea to set up an independent body to suggest fare hikes and other reforms was mooted during the United Progressive Alliance’s (UPA) tenure.In April 2017, the NDA government first approved the setting up of the Rail Development Authority (RDA), to make “Pricing of services commensurate with costs, suggest measures for enhancement of Non Fare Revenue, protection of consumer interests, by ensuring quality of service and cost optimization, promoting competition, efficiency and economy”, among other things.The RDA didn’t start functioning and railway ministry officials recently suggested that the creation of the body could take even more time, with parliamentary elections around the corner.The House panel, led by BJD’s Bhartruhari Mahtab, noted that “in view of the fact that the principals of sharing subsidies/ social costs involve reimbursement of such costs to the railways by finance ministry and other departments, the committee stress that the process of establishment of the proposed Railway Regulatory Authority be expedited.”The Parliamentary panel supported the idea of the merger of the rail budget with the general budget—a practice started since 2017—but expressed concern that a decision to demarcate between commercial and social activities of the Indian rail and the reimbursement of the social service obligation has not been done so far.",1
743,"Pepper traders cite Sri Lankan minister statement on illegal imports to IndiaIn a letter to the commerce minister, pepper consortium has raised concerns over spurt in illegal imports of Vietnam pepper.ET Bureau|Feb 12, 2019, 07.57 PM ISTKOCHI: The pepper traders have appealed to the commerce ministry to take steps to raise vigil to prevent the import of pepper from Vietnam through Sri Lanka with origin of certificate from the latter, citing the recent statement by a Sri Lankan minister in media. Kishore Shamji, the coordinator of the Kerala chapter of Indian Pepper and Spice Traders, Growers , Planters Consortium said in a letter to commerce minister Suresh Prabhu that Sri Lankan minister has said that he hasn’t been able to prevent the export of 156 containers of Vietnam pepper to India with certificate of origin from Sri Lanka as it is a racket similar to narcotics trafficking. ``We have been cautioning the Indian government since last week of January that 180 containers of about 1800 to 2000 tonnes of such pepper have left Sri Lankan coast,’’ he said.. This is over and above the pepper smuggled to India from Myanmar, Bangladesh and Nepal, he added The supply of Vietnam pepper is happening by evading duty to the tune of 43% as the duty for import from Vietnam is 51% against 8% for Sri Lanka under India Sri lanka Free Trade Agreement, circumventing the minimum import price of Rs 500 per kg fixed by India for pepper imports. Shamji said the Indian importer pays the minimum import price of Rs 500 ($ 7100 per tonne), for which duty comes to Rs 40 at 8%. Since the Sri Lankan pepper price is $ 3000 per tonne, the balance $4100 is in many cases not remitted. Those who are paying $ 7100 in full gets back the excess money through hawala in cash in Indian rupees. ` In both cases it is a violation of FEMA rules,’’ he alleged. He said such pepper are sold in Indian markets below the domestic price of Rs 350 per kg. Shamji urged the authorities to enforce steps to test for a minimum of 6% piperine content in such imports if it is for extraction purpose. The Vietnam pepper has only 4 to 5 % of piperine, he said.",0
744,"PM-KISAN to provide multiple benefits to farmers: CEAThe average income of farmers in 2015-16 was about Rs 30,000 and, hence, Rs 6,000 would be 20 per cent.PTI|Feb 17, 2019, 12.12 PM ISTNEW DELHI: Farm income support scheme PM-KISAN will provide multiple benefits to farmers, including improving their credit worthiness, said Chief Economic Adviser K V Subramanian. The Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi Yojana (PM-KISAN) was announced in the Interim Budget 2019-20, under which Rs 6,000 will be given in three instalments to 12 crore small and marginal farmers holding cultivable land up to 2 hectare. Producer support in India is very low compared to the other countries and the scheme will help in supplementing that, he told PTI. ""Across countries, producer support for farmers are quite high. The recent OECD study which talks about producers support in India is quite low. ""This section is the one which will be feeding 125 crore mouths and you have a population which is growing at less than 1 per cent and food production is growing at greater than 3 per cent,"" he said. Therefore, Subramanian said, there will be surpluses leading to fall in prices impacting income of farmers. Moreover, he said, the reason farming is supported in a lot of countries is that the risk-return trade-off is bad in the sector. ""Therefore, this constituent required support. There is definitely a case for supporting in a way that does not create distortion,"" he said. The other important benefit of this scheme is in terms of making farmers credit worthy as financial institutions have assured cash flow for this vulnerable section, he said. The average income of farmers in 2015-16 was about Rs 30,000 and, hence, Rs 6,000 would be 20 per cent, Subramanian said. ""If you have assured cash flow, banker can collateralise that and lend to the farmer up to Rs 24,000 in a year. ""Three four times of a Rs 6,000 assured income can be given to farmers by using the microfinance. What is important is that this is an assured return which has not been done so far. This is something financial institutions can indeed use,"" he added. It will have multiple benefits as it starts from basic premise that you need to be supporting an important constituent of economy which is vulnerable, he said, adding that it is something which is important. Prime Minister Narendra Modi will formally launch the scheme at a farmers' rally in Gorakhpur, Uttar Pradesh, on February 24. The data uploaded on the PM-KISAN portal till February 24 will be considered for transfer of the first instalment at the launch event and the second instalment will be given from April 1.",0

748,"Private players allowed only in infrastructure: Rail MinistryThe Railway Ministry on Wednesday said it has so far allowed infrastructure related investments in the rail sector, which is consistent with the government policy.Reacting to reports on private investment in the rail sector, the ministry said investment in container business was only to the extent of ownership of rolling stock and provision of container services as distinct from operation of such trains, which would be carried out by Indian Railways.As per the government's industrial policy, only railway transport is reserved for the public sector. Rail transport is defined as operation of freight and passenger trains and does not include ownership of track, rolling stock and other related infrastructure, the ministry said in a statement.It also said foreign direct investment up to 100 per cent is permitted under the automatic route in railway infrastructure as long as train operations were not involved.",1
749,"Privatisation must cover the whole rail sector, not just the railwaysEvery indicator, not just safety-related ones, underlines the travails of Indian Railways (IR). An instant solution is also offered. Every monopoly is inefficient, especially a public sector one. Liberalise, privatise, corporatise. Isn’t that how railways were developed in India, through private sector initiatives in the 19th century? Let’s leave aside history, where, the private sector didn’t exactly smell of roses. What do we mean by privatisation and what do we mean by IR? There is an IR that owns infrastructure (tracks, signalling, rolling stock, stations) and there is an IR that runs trains. There is also an IR that runs schools and hospitals, but since this is a non-core function, let’s just assume, eventually, IR sheds that. By privatisation, we may either mean private entry, or selling IR’s equity.Most services on trains and stations (cleaning, catering and maintenance) are already privatised. There is little IR does departmentally. Wagons are produced by the private sector. So, increasingly, are coaches and locomotives. What most people mean by private entry is the private sector running trains. On this, will we contemplate locomotive drivers from the private sector and safety (not to be confused with security) handled by the private sector? That’s worth thinking about. On privately run trains, most people don’t know policy already allows that. Why don’t we see them? There have been private luxury trains. On mainstream trains, there are two reasons. First, there has to minor tweaking of legislation to permit the private sector to charge fares and those fares, after the regulator has been set up, have to be reasonable. Second, any train, public or private, requires a path, from point A to point B. Today, capacity constraints are such that it is impossible to provide that path, for both passenger and goods trains. Sure, after freight corridors, capacity constraints will ease a bit. But fundamentally, easing requires huge investments, which IR’s present financial woes don’t allow. If you want to run a private train from Jodhpur to Jaisalmer, I am sure IR will find you a path. However, that’s not a remunerative segment. The private sector will be interested in high-density corridors, where there are capacity issues. Eventually, when private trains take off, they will run in those high density corridors. Who runs trains elsewhere? Will there be something like a universal service obligation? As a final element in private entry, what about stations? Private management of stations is one thing, private development is another. Private development requires a revenue model. Without land for commercial real estate development (like Delhi and Mumbai airports), it won’t work. At best, given distribution of IR land, this might happen for around 15 stations and no more.Let’s turn to privatisation through selling IR’s equity. Everything isn’t like IRCTC, IRCON or IRFC. A major problem is lack of proper commercial accounting in IR. Before buying something, you need to know its worth. Today, this isn’t possible. With successful pilots in zones/divisions already undertaken, there is no reason why the entire IR system shouldn’t have proper commercial accounting in the next two years. After that, production units (for manufacturing rolling stock) can certainly be hived off. There is no convincing market failure argument for these. But on infrastructure interpreted as tracks, signalling and related matters, all railways have a historical evolution and models imported from elsewhere can’t be easily implanted. It is a vertically and horizontally integrated structure, notwithstanding initial independent and regional developments in 19th century. Therefore, unbundling and privatising this is an expensive and pointless proposition. Once you have taken away the infrastructure, in the form of something like an IR Infrastructure Corporation, and hived off production units and non-core functions, what is left in the IR bit that runs trains, especially after private entry? There is nothing left to privatise there.",0
750,"Rabi cereals production to fall by nearly 10%: NBHCThis coupled with the drought in some parts have impacted Rabi sowing and could aggravate the distress in the farm sector.By Jayashree BhosaleAccording to the first estimate of rabi production in 2018-19, National Bulk Handling Corporation (NBHC), rabi cereals production is expected to decline by 9.91%, while chana/gram is the most affected pulse seeing 9.92% fall in acreage. ""As per our study, the total rabi cereals production for the year 2018-19 is expected to be lower by 9.91 per cent to 115.49 Million MT and wheat is expected to show a decline in area by 2.54 per cent to 29.66 Million Ha and production by 4.99 per cent to 94.72 Million MT owing to scanty and inequitable distribution of rainfall in major growing areas,"" an NBHC release said. The northeast monsoon, between October and December, over the country had been “Substantially below Normal”. The cumulative rainfall in the country during the post-monsoon season i.e. 01st October 2018 to 31st December 2018 has been 44 per cent lower than LPA. Rainfall in the four broad geographical divisions of the country during the above period have been lower than LPA by 51 per cent each in Central India & East & North East India, 45 per cent in North West India and 36 per cent in South Peninsula. This coupled with the drought in some parts have impacted Rabi sowing and could aggravate the distress in the farm sector. The southwest monsoon was almost 22 per cent below normal in the Marathwada region of Maharashtra, while in north interior Karnataka, the deficit was almost 29 per cent and 37 per cent below normal in Rayalseema. In Maharashtra, Vidarbha reported 88 per cent post-monsoon rainfall deficiency, which is the highest in the state. Similarly, drought affected regions like Marathwada received 84 per cent less rainfall, followed by central Maharashtra at 64 per cent deficiency and Konkan and Goa at 56 per cent rainfall deficiency in the post-monsoon period. According to NBHC, rabi rice acreage is recorded lower by 14.17 per cent and its production is expected to decrease significantly by 28.91 per cent due to major rice-growing states West Bengal, Odisha, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh are lagging sowing area. Total coarse cereals are expected to fall by 6.9 per cent to 12.1 million MT in 2018-19. This is due to a fall in production of Jowar, maize and barley. Jowar has seen the biggest fall in sowing, with around 2.52 million hectares, a fall of 18.82 per cent over last year. Area sown under maize and barley fell by 5.67 per cent and 2.62 per cent, respectively. NBHC has maintained that the most affected is the cultivation of pulses, particularly gram or chana. The acreage under gram is down in major growing States of Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Karnataka, which is reeling a drought. The gram acreage has decrease by 9.92 per cent to 9.70 million hectares from 10.76 million hectares in last year. Overall, the pulses have shown decrease by 6.75 per cent and the production is expected at 14.48 Million MT despite kulthi acreage and production increase significantly by 29.84 per cent and 31.23 per cent respectively. Masoor production is estimated 1.76 per cent lower at 1.71 Million MT as against 1.74 during 2017-18. ""However, oilseeds are the only crop which managed to retain last year’s level in terms of acreage with less than one per cent increase. A surge in mustard cultivation in Rajasthan has been critical in taking the total oilseeds sowing area to about 8.04 million hectares, which was 0.71 per cent higher than that in 2017-18. Mustard acreage is expected to increase by 5.03 per cent at 7.02 million hectares likewise production is expected to increase by 4.46 per cent to 8.69 million MT. Groundnut, Sunflower and safflower production for 2018-19 has been estimated to be lower at 0.97 million MT.,"" observed NBHC in its estimate.",0
751,"Rail budget to signal road to reform, says minister Suresh PrabhuThe railway budget will signal the direction of long-term reforms needed to revamp the world's fourth-largest rail network, minister Suresh Prabhu said on Thursday. ""The budget will set the direction of long and difficult road of reform,"" Prabhu told state-run broadcaster DD News ahead of his budget presentation.All eyes will be on Prabhu on Thursday on whether he will raise passenger fare and freight rates in his maiden rail budget to boost the cash-crunched railways and include proposals for Make in India initiatives besides enhancing safety and security.Minister of state for railway Manoj Sinha had earlier ruled out a reduction in fares in the context of falling diesel rates but Prabhu is expected to make a tight rope walk as he tries to bridge the huge gap in finances while presenting the budget in Lok Sabha.Prabhu is likely to unravel his grand plans of how to decrease the cross-subsidy for passenger service from freight earnings which is touching Rs 24,000 crore and the steps to increase goods transportation share in the national transporter with or without hiking fares.India's decrepit state-run train services stand to receive at least a 25% boost in investment to over $9 billion, funded solely by falling fuel costs, according to officials familiar with the railway budget.The world's fourth largest rail network could get even more if Prime Minister Narendra Modi makes it a priority, as China did during its rapid economic growth over the past two decades.There are high hopes that his nine-month-old government will plough money into investment in infrastructure needed to haul the economy out of a rut when it presents its first annual federal budget on Saturday.The rail budget could show how far Modi's India is prepared to drive investment in a vital transport sector.""The fall in diesel prices and a pick-up in freight earnings have given us a golden chance to raise investments,"" said one government official.An increase in the budget allocation would go some way to offset disappointment at the lack of private sector interest in investing in railways, after Modi's government last year suggested public-private partnerships for new routes.",1
752,"Rail budget: There’s a lot riding on rail modernisationSuresh Prabhu covered a lot of ground in his railway budget setting out four goals, five drivers and 11 thrust areas for his ministry. First the good news: No new trains or projects were announced, which means that already crowded tracks will not be further burdened and we will see an improved punctuality of passenger and goods trains. The bad news is that he has shied away from hiking passenger fares which remain abysmally low at Rs 0.30 per km, lower than Delhi Metro’s fare of Rs 1 per km.Leading the 11 ‘thrust areas’ is ‘quality of journey’ for the passengers ranging from providing 17,000 bio-toilets in coaches to 650 new toilets at various stations. He has promised e-catering on 108 trains for passengers to get the food of their choice, apps for train bookings, improved access for the disabled, new helplines for women and the facility to purchase a ticket online in five minutes!He also proposed more satellite terminals to reduce overcrowding of existing ones, but has pinned his hopes on the PPP (Public Private Partnership) model which is a highly indeterminate option and could result in turning over Railways’ land to property dealers. Some new innovations include setting up electronic displays at 2000 major stations to show real time status of trains, of course with private participation which would lead to advertising, adding to the cacophony and noise pollution on platforms.Booking tickets 120 days in advance will undoubtedly help citizens to plan in advance, but a higher penalty for last minute cancellation of booking would have also helped to discourage touts who manage to block tickets during the busy festival season.Prabhu has placed great faith in union transport, highways and shipping minister Nitin Gadkari who would help him with providing rail connectivity to ports. For improving rail safety he has drawn heavily on the Anil Kakodkar report proposing the ATP (Automatic Train Protection) system which will be very expensive.Plans are afoot for roping in PSUs to partner the Railways in providing better connectivity to transport their raw material and finished products such as coal, steel and cement. Prabhu has claimed a good preliminary response but how much this will translate into reality remains to be seen.Businesses will welcome proposals for automatic fare rebate for loading wagons on (empty) return journeys. But the results could be mixed since matching consignments with availability of empty wagons will not be easy and could also result in higher wagon turnround affecting operational efficiency.Suresh has promised to build 970 RUBs (Road Under Bridge) and ROBs (Road Over Bridge) to eliminate unmanned level crossings that caused accidents.Setting up a Logistics Corporation will usher in an era of greater involvement by the Railways in multi-modal transport by setting up new facilities at hundreds of disused goods sheds. Undoubtedly partnering with major private logistics providers will be crucial for the success of the scheme.The only redeeming feature of this year’s rail budget is the fact that at last realisation has dawned on the powers that be, that populism has to give way to pragmatism for regaining the financial health of the nation’s economic life line and a crucial engine of growth!The size of the Plan Budget has gone up by 52% from Rs. 65,798 crore in 2014-15 to Rs 1,00,011 crore in 2015-16. Support from the central government constitutes 41.6% of the total Plan budget and internal generation 17.8%, perhaps the best financial indicator to ensure that the Railways will at last be moving on the right track.",1

We have to move merely providing rail infrastructure to other support services such as technology up gradation, better logistic support and better passenger services in an integrated manner,  said  Rajen Gohain, Minister of State for Railways, while inaugurating an ASSOCHAM conference on ‘ASSOCHAM International Summit on Invest Rail .’ “Need of the hour in Indian Railways is the massive investment and new technology without which we cannot move to become a world class transporter. Thus, the plan is to increase investment to nearly one trillion rupees in the next decade”, said Mr Rajen Gohain. Thus, Rail is the right forum for investment that can address nearly all investments challenges such as ensuring reduced global warming, volatile fuel costs, having lower energy consumption, reducing urban congestion, having less land usage, servicing an aging population and making transportation accessible to all ages across all income brackets. In addition, rail has lower infrastructure renewal and maintenance cost which is often mentioned as 20 times lower per ton kilometre that other forms. “Investment in rail will thus help in the planets sustainable and environmental goals and help in meeting the greenhouse gas emission targets. In addition, rail offers a more stable and sustainable form of transportation. We, in Indian Railways, are thus trying to have a collaborative approach in bringing governments, local authorities, railways and other stakeholders on the same wave length for a more sustainable form of transport system”, mentioned Mr. Gohain. Investing in rail stimulates the economy while reducing CO2 emissions and urban congestion. As many countries worldwide plan to step up their investments in rail over the next decade, we in Indian Railways can and must do more. While India has the world’s fourth largest rail network, it has been outstripped by /china, which now has more than six times as much track following an intensive expansion and modernisation of its network over the past two decades. We are thus also looking in using PPP more- or as articulated in the coming years. We aim to keep people at the centre of all our activities and investments in our journey, said Railway Minister. Indian Railways has one of the biggest network in the world and is recognised as one of the largest organisation under single management. It is also an admitted fact that for the past couple of centuries, transportation has fuelled the world’s economy. In this context, for the country’s economic and environmental health, it is thus time to restore the balance between road, air and rail. Others who also spoke during the conference were H.E.

The allies of main political party used to demand the railway ministry to join the government. The party which came to power at Centre also used the railway ministry as a bargaining tool to distribute trophies to its allies. This is a bitter truth,"" he said. ""Leaders from political parties who got the control of the railways were not interested in (development of) railways and I need not say what they were interested in,"" Modi said.The Prime Minister today laid the foundation stone for redevelopment of Gandhinagar railway station, which will get a face-lift at a cost of Rs 250 crore and will have a 300-room five star hotel built atop.""My government has given priority to railways... it should expand, it should be developed, get modernised and it should bring a qualitative change in the lives of common people.”""We have tried to do this in the last two years and five months. We have increased the budget of railways to double of what it was,"" he said.Modi listed various works done by his government to develop railways and said the pace of doubling of railway tracks has increased, besides speeding up of gauge conversion and electrification of lines. He said free WiFi has been provided at railway stations.The Central government is working to increase speed of trains and also striving to bring in global technology to make railways safer, as ""safety is of greatest concern"", Modi said.""In developed countries, 70 per cent goods transportation is carried out by railways while rest by roads. However in India, 15 to 20 per cent is through railways while 70 to 80 per cent is by roads. Goods tend to get costlier when transported by roads. We are stressing on development of freight corridors,"" he said.The Prime Minister also said that railway stations located in cities can be developed by constructing high-rise buildings atop them.Gandhiangar railway station will be redeveloped through a special purpose vehicle (SPV) formed between the Gujarat government and the Indian Railway Stations Development Corporation Ltd (IRSDC). The proposed name of the SPV is Gandhinagar Railway & Development Corporation Ltd.The project includes redevelopment of the railway station as well as the construction of a 300-room five star hotel atop the station. The hotel, with three towers, will be around 65 metres tall.Railway Minister Suresh Prabhu said his ministry is planning to replicate such redevelopment at 23 railway stations across the country.",1
764,"Railways agents misused demonetisation waivers: CAGIn November 2016, 132 Indian Railways’ Jansadharan Ticket Booking Sewaks (JTBS) took unfair advantage of a three-day-long waiver facility provided by the government to allow transactions at railway ticketing counters after the shock demonetisation order of November 8, and deposited unusually big quantities of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 currency notes on the three subsequent days, a CAG report has found out.The 132 JTBS were from the Central, Eastern, Northeast Frontier, North Eastern, North Western and Western Railway (CR, ER, NFR, NER, NWR and WR) zones. On November 9, 2016, the Railway Board, had issued a directive that the Rs500 and Rs 1,000 bank notes would not cease to be legal tender from November 9, 2016 until November 11, 2016, to the extent of transactions at railway ticketing counters for purchase of tickets, for which complete records were required to be maintained.The CAG report said: “Audit test checked the transactions carried out by 132 JTBSs during 07 November 2016 to 11 November 2016 on 59 stations of six Zonal Railways. A comparison of deposits made by the JTBSs for five days of pre and post demonetisation revealed that post demonetization, total cash deposited by these 132 JTBSs exceeded their normal pre-demonetization cash deposit by significant amounts…”The national auditor observed — “No specific directives/instructions were issued by the Railway Board in respect of cash deposited by the JTBSs in Railway’s Deposit Accounts essential for issue/sale of unreserved tickets through computerised Unreserved Ticketing System. 132 JTBS in six Zonal Railways took undue advantage of the facility provided by the Government of India to allow transactions at railway ticketing counters and deposited specified bank notes with the Railways post demonetisation instead of depositing the cash in the banks”.Started in 2008 in order to cut down long queues at railway stations, the JTBS scheme permits an individual to sell railway tickets outside railway stations. The JTBS charges Rs 1 per ticket but can sell only unreserved tickets and cannot issue concession tickets. ",1
765,"Railways begin work on export policyIndian Railways is working on an export policy under which top officials from the country’s coach factories will be able to visit other countries to seek bulk orders for train coaches. The absence of an export policy has impeded the ability of state-run factories to seek regular overseas orders, after executing the last order for coaches, from Sri Lanka, in 2010-12.The railways is looking at Southeast Asia, the Middle East and Africa for potential customers under the proposed policy, seeking alternative sources of revenue by capitalising on the cost advantage offered by its coach factories, which build train cars up to a fifth cheaper than overseas competitors. The policy will empower officials of the rank of general managers and above to take decisions and sew up deals quickly.“Manufacturing coaches is one part where we have good capacity and we can maintain international standards as well. Also, the cost per coach will be 20-25% less than what is there in other parts of the world. If a policy is in place, we will be able to take frequent orders and our officials won’t have to take approval for every decision. They will be free to take decisions,” said Rajesh Aggarwal, member (rolling stock) of the Railway Board.Aggarwal said that even to travel abroad, an official now needs to seek approval from the railway ministry and Railway Board.“We have been doing exports through RITES, but with export policies, we will be able to take direct orders,” Railway board chairman Ashwani Lohani said. RITES is a state-run consulting company that specialises in transport infrastructure.Railways recently exported the first set of Diesel Electric Multiple Units to Sri Lanka from Integral Coach Factory (ICF) in Chennai. ICF has exported coaches and coach components to various countries like Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan, Vietnam, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Tanzania, Mozambique, Angola, Nigeria and Uganda.“ICF is expecting another order from Sri Lanka railways for export of 160 coaches and the modalities are being worked out along with RITES Ltd. Advanced levels of negotiations are going on between Indian Railways and Bangladesh Railways for export of coaches from ICF,” said S Mani, general manager of ICF.Railway is prepared to manufacture both standard and meter gauge coaches and Modern Coach Factory at Raebareli in Uttar Pradesh is being expanded to increase capacity.“The capacity of coach factory in Indian Railway is good and underdeveloped countries can be a good market for India. But quality should be maintained in order to get good revenue,” said RK Singh, former chairman of the Railway Board.",1

768,"Railways Minister flying high on taxpayers moneyUnion Ministers are busy people, and perennially unsure of their schedule. Or so it would seem from the considerable bill run up by the Union Railways Minister on charter planes and multiple bookings.As part of a series on the misuse of public funds by various ministries of the government of India, an investigation into the workings of the Railways Ministry reveals that rail officials frequently have bent rules to provide charter planes to Union Railways Minister Piyush Goyal since he got the portfolio in September 2017. This has cost the public exchequer 15-20 times more than what it would have cost for the minister to board regular planes.A Railways rule underlines that the Railways can hire a charter plane or helicopter only in case of railway accidents. A minister cannot hire a charter plane for official business unless he is inspecting an accident site.It is also worth noting that Narendra Modi had invoked austerity measures soon after his swearing-in as Prime Minister in 2014. The rulebook states that all government officials including ministers have to fly Air India unless flights are not available in emergency situations. However, Railways officials let Piyush Goyal and his two junior ministers in the Railways, take private airlines instead of Air India.In addition to this, the Minister’s office buys two to three air tickets for the same destination on a given day just to ensure that Goyal doesn’t miss his flight. This expense is paid by the Railways, so essentially it is at the expense of Indian taxpayers.In September 2017, within days of swearing-in as Union Railways Minister, Piyush Goyal’s office put out a request for hiring a charter plane to travel from Delhi to Surat and later Mumbai. In response to the request for hiring a charter plane, Additional General Manager, Northern Railways Manju Gupta wrote to the Railways Board: “The Schedule of Powers, vide para 58 of Part-A (Powers of General Manager), empowers the GM/DRMs to requisition helicopter/aeroplane to reach the site of serious accident for rescue operations expeditiously and to evacuate injured and dead in the event of serious accident. No such powers for hiring/booking chartered flight/helicopter for Hon’ble MR (Minister of Railway) have been given therein.’’Newslaundry has accessed this letter. The letter also states that the Railways Board should put appropriate norms in place since “such demands [for charter flights] may arise’’ in future. The letter proposes that the Railways Board should depute a Railways Public Sector Unit (PSU) to hire charter planes if need be. After receiving the letter, the Railways Board without wasting any time appointed Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation (IRCTC) to hire charter planes for the Minister.Goyal, however, later dropped his Surat travel plan. It is unclear how the Railways Board could appoint the IRCTC to overrule a central government circular. Later, as per Railways records accessed by Newslaundry, IRCTC did book charter planes for Piyush on at least three occasions.Records show that Goyal first flew along with his wife Seema Goyal and his private secretary to Mumbai-Belgaum-Delhi on a three-day trip (February 9-11, 2018), which cost Rs 13 lakh. His second charter flight to Shani Shingnapur-Shirdi-Tulapur (pilgrimage places known for their temples) and later to Latur on April 2 cost Rs 25.50 lakh. This trip coincided with a bhoomi poojan of a coach factory he attended at Latur. And on June 2, he travelled from Delhi to Jodhpur and then back to Delhi on a charter plane, costing over Rs 10 lakh.Goyal’s charter plane seems to have incurred more expenses towards waiting rather than flying if one is to go by the three-day Belgaum schedule put out by his office. A charter plane takes anything between Rs 2 lakh and Rs 3 lakh per hour as waiting charge.According to the schedule, he arrived at Belgaum at 10:00 am on February 10. The charter plane remained parked till 8.15 pm on February 11, and then it took off to Delhi, his final destination. And when the plane was parked, the minister travelled by road to inspect a site of road over-bridge, paid tribute to Mahatma Gandhi at Belagavi railway station, inaugurated UTS Mobile ticketing App over South Western Railways Zone from Belagavi railway station and works to the facelift of the station building.Piyush Goyal also interacted with industrialists and members of Chamber of Commerce. The function went on for an hour to get members’ views on the forthcoming annual budget and Railways infrastructure.It would have cost Goyal less than Rs 50,000 if he had taken a routine return flight to Belgaum, assuming he was travelling by business class. But a charter plane cost taxpayers nearly Rs 13 lakh. The minister inaugurated a Railways App and discussed the budget with businessmen. Again, it should be remembered that the minister is not entitled to charter planes unless he is inspecting an accident site.During his charter flight to Latur in April, Goyal first went to pay homage to deities. “I’m fortunate to have darshan of Shani mandir in Shani Shingnapur this morning; I took blessings of Sai Baba at Shirdi and then went to Tuljapur to take blessings of Maa Bhawani before coming to Latur,’’ he was later quoted saying in his speech. Piyush did bhoomi pujan of a coach factory at Latur and wound up the tour. The chartered flight alone cost the exchequer Rs 25.50 lakh.Piyush and his family visited Shani Shingnapur in the past too. According to his website, he had visited Shani Shingnapur on October 26, 2016, along with his wife and son Dhruv.Moreover, one of his latest trips by a special plane was to Jodhpur, where he flagged off Humsafar Jodhpur-Bandra Express. This cost taxpayers a little over Rs 10 lakh.",1

771,"Railways, Urban Development Ministries To Redevelop Stations Under Smart City PlansIn a major initiative, railway stations and adjoining areas will be redeveloped on Smart City lines for enhancing passenger amenities, easy access to stations, enabling optimal utilization of land at railway stations, as a part of Smart City development. A Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was signed in this regard by the Ministries of Urban Development and Railways in the presence of Shri M.Venkaiah Naidu and Shri Suresh Prabhu. Dr.Sameer Sharma, Mission Director, Smart City Mission and Shri Rajiv Chaudhary, Advisor, Ministry of Railways signed the MoU. Both the Ministers lauded the joint initiative as a historic landmark that brings synergy in development of smart cities since there can’t be a smart city without a smart railway station. M.Venkaiah Naidu said on the occasion that this convergence based city development will result in qualitative improvement in city life. He suggested involvement of local people in redevelopment plans. Naidu suggested that to begin with 10 cities could be taken up for the proposed redevelopment with the involvement of National Buildings Construction Corporation(NBCC) which has successfully executed redevelopment projects on self-financing basis. These cities are : Sarai Rohilla (Delhi), Bhubaneswwar, Lucknow, Varnasi, Jaipur, Kota, Thane, Margao(Goa), Tirupati and Puducherry. This was agreed to by Railway Minister. Minister of Railways Suresh Prabhu said that railway stations have been the core of city development and have become congested over time and their redevelopment offers immense opportunities for changing city landscape. Stating that redevelopment work of Habibganj railway station has already been awarded and plans for Anand Vihar (Delhi), Surat, Bijwasan and Gandhinagar are in advanced stage. He said that several countries like Germany, France, Japan, South Korea, UK and Belgium have showed interest in redevelopment and a Round Table of domestic and overseas bankers will be organized next week to discuss financing of these redevelopment projects. To be implemented first in the 100 cities included in the Smart City Mission, redevelopment of railway stations will be undertaken in AMRUT (Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation) and HRIDAY (Heritage Infrastructure Development and Augmentation Yojana) cities extending the scope of the MoU to over 500 cities. Railway station and the adjoining area in each of these cities will be redeveloped on the lines of Area Based Development provided in the Smart City Mission Guidelines. Average cost of redevelopment of identified area of about 500 acres in the Smart City Plans of 60 cities approved so far comes to about Rs.1,500 cr. The proposed redevelopment involving railway stations envisages improving passenger amenities, easy access to stations, integrated public transport hub, waiting halls and other amenities for passengers, development of residential and commercial spaces, land scaping etc. The joint initiative of the Ministries of Urban Development and Railways widens the smart city development to one more area in each of the mission cities with each city required to select one area under respective Smart City Plans in the first phase. The MoU proposes two Joint Venture options for speedy redevelopment of railway station centred areas. The first being between the Railways and the Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) formed for execution of Smart City Plans, with equal share in equity. In the second model, National Buildings Construction Corporation (NBCC) can be roped in with equal share among the three. NBCC can design, develop and execute the redevelopment plans on self-financing basis. While the Ministry of Railways takes the responsibility of forming Joint Ventures, the Ministry of Urban Development will work with the States and Urban Local Bodies for integrating railway station redevelopment as part of smart city development plans. MoU states that ‘Both railway station redevelopment and Smart City concepts are part of holistic development of respective city. Redevelopment of railway station and its suburbs as part of Smart City Plans leads to an integrated public transport hub around railway station and encourage Transit Oriented Development.” The validity of the MoU is five years to begin with and can be extended with the consent of both the Ministries. Smart City Plans of some cities have already included area based development surrounding railway stations. These include; Bhubaneswar, Thane and Solapur (Maharashtra), Kakinada (Andhra Pradesh), Ahmedabad, Ajmer, Hubli-Dharwad (Karnataka). Smart City Plans of some other cities may potentially impact city railway station and allied services. These include; Jaipur, Kochi, Jabalpur, Visakhapatnam, Indore, Pune, Bhopal, Chennai etc.",0

Of the 54 consequential train accidents in 2017 (between April 1 and December 15), five were reported from ECR.Rescue and relief works in progress after the nine coaches of Delhi-bound Seemanchal Express derailed at Sahadai Buzurg station in Vaishali district, Hajipur on February 3.(PTI Photo)East Central Zone of the Indian Railways, where 11 coaches of the Seemanchal Express (Jogbani-Anand Vihar) derailed on Sunday, is notorious for accidents.In a safety review in December, it emerged as the second-worst zone (of the total 18) in terms of consequential train accidents followed by the Northern Railway. It recorded five such incidents between April 1, 2018 and December 15, 2018. Northern Railway reported eight such incidents during the period. The total number stood at 45.The Indian Railways has adopted a “Zero Accident” policy, and the number of passengers killed in various railway accidents was lowest in 2017-18 (57). But deaths caused by derailments make experts worried. The Railways categorises accidents the following categories: collision, derailment, mishaps at manned level crossings, mishaps at unmanned level crossings and fire.“Bulk of railways’ money goes to staff cost and fuel...there is little left for the maintenance. Derailment of a passenger train is a major embarrassment for the railways, and they must do track maintenance on priority. The zone where the accident has taken used to be called the sleeping division, as efforts to improve tracks were less. This accident is a symptom that tracks and coaching maintenance are faulty and need to be fixed,” said Sri Prakash, who retired as member (traffic) of the Indian Railways in 2009.The East Central Railway comprises Dhanbad, Mughal Sarai, Samastipur and Danapur divisions.

But the main rabi crop of wheat may have scraped through the inclement weather. While the rains will help cut the cost of irrigationNSE -1.73 % for the wheat crop, these are set to affect the output of oilseeds. “Mustard is affected by heavy rains as well as strong gust in several district ,” a senior official at the Haryana agriculture department said. Growers of peas, potato and cauliflower have suffered heavy losses as their crops are affected by the hailstorm. While mustard has taken a hit in Haryana, the weather has damaged the potato crop in Punjab. Wheat is expected to gain from the precipitation, though there could be a marginal yield loss in hailstorm-affected areas. As the wheat crop has not attained height, the wind and rain have not affected it,” an official of Punjab’s agriculture department said, adding: “But hailstorm has affected all the crops.” Officials, however, have alerted farmers about the risk of yellow rust that dwells in wet weather. Hailstorm and strong winds have caused damage in several pockets in districts of Sirsa, Hisar, Mahendergarh, Palwal, Bhiwani Kaithal and Gurgaon in Haryana. The Haryana government has decided to conduct survey of damage to crops In Punjab, initial reports indicate crop losses in Patiala, Ludhiana, Fatehgarh Sahib, Hoshiarpur, Mohali and Ferozepur. “There are preliminary reports of damage to crops, mainly perishables, but it will take a few days for the assessment of the extent of loss,” Punjab’s principal secretary of agriculture, KS Pannu, said.

777,"Rice Exports to gather steam on US, West Asia demand boostRice exports from India are set to swing in the last quarter of this year on a spate in orders after shipments slumped 14% in the last three quarters over high input costs and tepid demand from Bangladesh.By Parshant KrarChandigarh: Rice exports from India are set to swing in the last quarter of this year on a spate in orders after shipments slumped 14% in the last three quarters over high input costs and tepid demand from Bangladesh. “Consignments in January are better than the previous year and the trade is likely to attain levels close to the previous year,” a senior commerce and industry ministry official told ET. Exporters have seen a surge in demand from the United Arab Emirates, Iran, Saudi Arabia and the US this quarter. The official said the supply for exports has streamlined after being affected for the last few months of 2018 because of assembly polls in some states. A bumper yield in Bangladesh also took toll on Indian exports, he said. The 5% subsidy on export value extended to non-basmati rice under the Merchandise Exports from India Scheme (MEIS) in November helped in recovery of trade , but margins remained thin, exporters said. “Raw material (paddy) prices are still high as most farmers are inclined to sell to the state agencies in states, including Chhattisgarh,” said P Baskara Reddy, promoter of Kakinada-based Sri Chitra Agri Exports. He said the exporters hope that the scheme will be extended beyond March 26 and the incentive doubled to 10% under MEIS to complement the shrinking margins. The announcement of higher price assistance by political parties just ahead of the harvesting season in the run-up to the assembly polls had spiked government procurement and dampened private purchase in states like Chhattisgarh where the procurement price was higher by 60%. The non-basmati rice exports that are dependent largely on varieties grown in Chhattisgarh were affected as paddy supply dried up following announcement of higher than minimum support price (MSP). Exporters are wary of such politically motivated price assistance. “Higher procurement price will subdue trade in the coming years. Direct financial assistance is a better route to support farmers,” Rice Exporters’ Association president BV Krishan Rao said. Higher procurement would lead to a surplus buffer stock and a situation where the government will have to auction its stocks at a loss, he said. “Similar situation took place in 1999-2000 when Food Corporation of India had to release its brimming stocks at a discount after higher MSP had boosted federal procurement three-times over the buffer stock norms,” Rao said. The rice procurement crossed 41 lakh tonnes so far compared to 32.5 lakh tonnes in Chhattisgarh in the last Kharif marketing season. “We have not taken export commitments this season as farmers are keen to sell to government agencies,” a senior executive of Uttar Pradesh-based Laxmi Rice Mills said. While export of basmati rice has increased till December, non-basmati exports stayed downhill with 5.6 million tonnes of shipment till December as against 6.3 MT a year ago.",0

The two pilots, Squadron Leader Samir Abrol and Squadron Leader Siddhartha Negi, died on the spot.The arresters installed at HAL airport are expected to stop aircraft that weigh up to 30 tonnes travelling at speeds of up to 160-170 knots. The Mirage 2000 trainer weighs much less, 13-14 tonnes, and was travelling at a speed of less than 160 knots, the officials added.Abrol and Negi were on an “acceptance sortie” of the Mirage 2000 trainer aircraft after it was overhauled by the Bengaluru-based, state-owned company. The sortie was taking place on the HAL runway in Yemalur in Bengaluru on February 1.An HAL spokesperson declined comment. An Indian Air Force (IAF) spokesperson, too, declined comment because of the ongoing court of inquiry into the accident.Read more| ‘My son loved to fly Mirage 2000’, says father of IAF officer killed in crash in BengaluruThe accident occurred a day after IAF chief Air Chief Marshal BS Dhanoa criticised HAL, and also pointed to the number of pilots who lost their lives testing the state-owned firm’s indigenously developed aircraft.According to the officials, the number of times major snags have been detected by IAF at the time of delivery in an aircraft overhauled or manufactured by HAL is high. For instance, last June, an Su-30 was on an acceptance sortie (its 13th) when it crashed near Nashik. The pilot and the flight engineer ejected successfully. These sorties are done by IAF only after HAL has flown the aircraft a certain number of times and cleared them for acceptance.In 2018-2019, the Russian designed Su-30Mki – the mainstay fighter of the IAF – manufactured by HAL required as many as six sorties as against the designated two sorties before they could be accepted. “The increased number of sorties is because snags were found,” a second senior government official said.Read more | Outdated jets for IAF, cheese & wine for babus: Pilot’s brother pens poemSimilarly, Mirage 2000 aircraft overhauled by HAL have, on average, required two sorties more than the mandatory number because of snags. And, Jaguars, the British made deep-strike bombers that are overhauled by HAL, have required, on average, three sorties more than the two sorties designated for acceptance. For the advanced light helicopters (ALH), flown by the Indian Army, Navy and Air Force, and also made by HAL, the numbers are equally bad.“Every aircraft needs to go through a certain number of sorties testing various test points before it can be accepted by IAF for deployment. The fact that the more sorties are having to be flown to rectify the snags indicates either the process of testing is not being done properly by the manufacturer or the process lacks rigorousness at the HAL end,” said Air Marshal SBP Sinha (retd), who till recently was the Air Officer Commanding at the Central Air Command of IAF.Arrester barriers are installed at the end of the runway to deal with exactly the kind of situation the overhauled Mirage 2000 trainer was facing. They are meant to stop an aircraft that has either aborted take-off or made an emergency landing from overshooting the runway with minimal damage to aircraft or injury to the crew.In this case, the Mirage 2000 trainer came down seconds after take-off. The undercarriage of the aircraft was sheared off, most likely because of the impact. And the arrester barrier was the only way that the two test pilots could have brought the aircraft to a stop.The black box of the fighter has been sent to France for a detailed analysis to assist the Court of Inquiry (CoI) that is investigating the crash. “Separately, inquiries are also being conducted on why the arrester barrier gave way,” said a senior HAL official who asked not to be named.",0

780,"Scrap free pass for rail employees’Railway activists on Sunday demanded that perks like free suburban passes for railway employees as well as their families be taken away from both Central and Western railway employees, to save more time and money.They were reacting to the Central Railway’s proposal of limiting the validity of return tickets to six hours. Subhash Gupta from Rail Pravasi Sangh and also a member of CR’s Divisional Railway Users Consultative Committee (DRUCC) said, “Officials said that the idea was proposed to save time and, on the other hand, the railway employees are issued passes that can be used for unlimited number of journeys for free.”A railway official revealed on the condition of anonymity that around 3.5 lakh railway employees and family members avail of this facility in Central Railway’s (CR) head office at CST and Western Railway’s (WR) at Mumbai Central.“The railway passes is resulting in a loss of approximately Rs 7 to Rs 7.5 crore yearly as a result of this facility to its employees,” said the official.The passes include both second and first class but most of the passes get issued for first class,” he further added.Mr Gupta said the railway city officials should discuss the proposal and the passes with the unions.“It is in common knowledge that free passes are not given to not only to the employees but also to the immediate family and it is a burden that the Mumbai railway can no longer bear” he said.“The railway employees should at least get together with the union and discuss the issue,” he further added.",1
781,"Send a message: Pakistan’s weakest pressure points are financial rather than militaryIndia can work with the US, EU and other major powers to impose tough sanctions on Pakistan’s military-ISI elite which drives its security policies and much else in the country.TNN|Feb 25, 2019, 11.16 AM ISTFollowing the Pulwama terror attack Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan claimed he needed “actionable intelligence” on Jaish-e-Muhammed’s (JeM) role, despite the terror outfit itself claiming responsibility for the attack. Since then, the Pakistani Punjab government has moved to take control of the seminaries in Bahawalpur, thought to be JeM’s headquarters. But information minister Fawad Chaudhry claiming these are purely religious madrasas, with no connection to JeM, showed Islamabad up to its usual game of making token gestures whenever international heat is cranked up on it. It does indicate an area of vulnerability, though, which is worth building upon if New Delhi is to inflict a high cost on Pakistan for harbouring terror safe havens. Military strikes are difficult at this point since the element of surprise is gone; moreover terror facilities such as Bahawalpur are likely to have been evacuated by now. But Pakistan is short of foreign currency; indeed its policy of nurturing terror creates chronic internal instability which prevents it from having a viable usual game of making token gestures whenever international heat is cranked up on it. Giving proof to Pakistan on terror activities from its soil has been proven to be pointless by now, but lobbying international agencies has had some success. The UN Security Council has, for the first time, condemned a terror strike in Kashmir and blamed JeM for it. New Delhi must strongly lobby international financial agencies such as IMF or FATF to blacklist Pakistan and deny it financial bailouts, till such time as it can roll up its terror infrastructure. This also serves US interests, as it can roll up its terror infrastructure. This also serves US interests, as it would like to see a stable Afghanistan when it leaves. New Delhi and Washington should work closely together on this. India can, in addition, work with the US, EU and other major powers to impose tough sanctions on Pakistan’s military-ISI elite which drives its security policies and much else in the country. Such sanctions would quickly bring Pakistan around, and the argument for them can be reinforced by putting the international community on notice that further terror outrages such as 26/11 or Pulwama will lead to an automatic military response from India, as India has the right to defend itself and domestic public opinion will not stand for anything less.",0

All the seven persons — four men, two women and an eight-year-old girl — died on the spot. Six of the deceased were in the ambulance while one was travelling in the car, police said.“The ambulance was going from Jammu to Patna and carrying the body of one Zakir Ansari. The driver, Hari Singh from Jammu, was killed in the accident,” said SP Sharma, in-charge of Baldeo police station in Mathura.Police have been able to identify five of the deceased. These included Jehangir Alam 36, Mohd Tahir Ansari, 32, Suhail Ahmad, 30, and ambulance driver Hari Singh, police said.“Those in the car on the other side of divider were from Tundla town in Firozabad.

783,"Smriti Irani in Amethi ahead of PM’s visit, accuses Rahul Gandhi of lyingAhead of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to Amethi on March 3, union textile minister Smriti Irani on Sunday reached the Congress bastion to launch a scathing attack on local MP and Congress president Rahul Gandhi.Her Amethi visit was timed with the launch of the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN) Scheme by the PM in Gorakhpur on Sunday.Distributing Kisan Samman Nidhi certificates to 25 farmers from Amethi in a symbolic launch of cash transfer scheme during a programme at Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya in Gauriganj, Irani repeatedly accused Gandhi of “lying”.Hailing the PM-KISAN Scheme, she said it would benefit 3.80 lakh farmers of Amethi alone. Modi had last visited Amethi on the final day of the 2014 Lok Sabha poll campaign, a visit which political experts believe helped Irani put up an impressive fight against Gandhi in just about 20 days.She had brought down Gandhi’s victory margin to one lakh votes in 2014, down from 3 lakh in 2009. Irani is widely tipped to re-contest against Congress chief Rahul Gandhi in the 2019 LS polls.“Five years back, Narendra Modiji had promised development. He has honoured his promise even as Amethi’s ‘naamdaar’ family only sold dreams to you,” she said after listening to Modi’s radio show ‘Mann ki Baat’.Accusing Gandhi of never raising the issue of “Amethi’s development” in Lok Sabha, she said: “Your local MP never cared about the development of Amethi but about 1.40 lakh people in Amethi benefited through Modi government’s Ujjawala scheme and another 1.25 lakh got the benefits of Ayushman Bharat Scheme which provides illness cover of up to Rs 5 lakh per annum to each poor household.”“The Modi government gave you ‘izzat ghar’ (toilets). In record time, the Yogi Adityanath government in UP has identified poor farmers who would benefit under the Kisan Samman Nidhi,” she said, stressing that only the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) could develop Amethi.She said the Modi government honoured 12 farmers with Padma awards.Irani inspected the venue where the PM would address the people of Amethi and also met BJP leaders who have been tasked with ensuring a good turnout for Modi’s rally.Both the Samajwadi Party (SP) and the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) have decided against fielding a candidate from Amethi and Rae Bareli in 2019 LS polls – a decision likely to benefit the Congress.",0

785,"Spontaneous rail roko hits Central RailwayA technical snag at the level crossing at Bhivpuri railway station triggered commuter unrest at Badlapur Friday early morning.Hundreds of angry commuters gathered on platforms and railway tracks to stage a “rail roko” for nearly six hours, from 5.05 am till such time the protest was called off after a written assurance from the stationmaster. Meanwhile, Amitabh Ojha, divisional railway manager (DRM), held commuters responsible and said he would find out the anti-social elements responsible for fanning the agitation. A CST-bound local got delayed owing to signal failure at Bhivpuri which sparked off the protest. What started as an argument between commuters and the stationmaster turned into a full-blown rail roko. “At first, there were only four railway police present at the station but when commuters stepped in front of the train to stop it and did not budge for half-an-hour, we deployed around 160 personnel on an emergency basis. We were afraid it would escalate into a Diva-like situation,” said an official on condition of anonymity. Initially, a handful of commuters started protesting irregular rail services on Central Railway (CR) but soon, hundreds of commuters, who face the same plight every day, joined in.Passengers stopped all trains plying into and out of the station and shouted slogans against CR. They were in no mood to listen to the railway police or commuters’ association or pravasi sanghatana. Finally, railway minister Suresh Prabhu had to intervene and request commuters to end their agitation.Following Mr Prabhu’s tweet, Mr Ojha reached Badlapur around 10 am and held a meeting with railway officials and the railway police. City police too attended the meeting. The police then tried to get commuters off the railway tracks but in vain. At about 10.40 am, the stationmaster assured commuters that local trains would run on time and would not be delayed. He urged them to stop agitating and allow trains to move.Only after a written assurance from him did commuters call off the protest, and the first train of the day which had been stopped at Badlapur since 5.05 am, started its journey at 10.52 am.By end of the day, CR saw more than 50 services cancelled and more than 65 trains delayed. ""We are expecting even bigger numbers by end of the day. The Kalyan-Thane section had no trains, and we began to run special trains between Ambernath and CSTM/Kalyan, Vangani and Karjat, and Khopoli,"" said another official on condition of anonymity.After train services resumed, Mr Ojha, while speaking with media persons, said that some anti-social elements were behind the protest. ""We are trying to find the people who started the protest at the railway station early morning. We suspect they were not regular commuters but probably some anti-social elements and we will trace them,"" he said. However, no complaint against unknown persons was filed with the railway police till evening.Advocate R.S. Godbole, adviser to pravasi sanghatana, said that the population of Badlapur had increased over the past five years as most people from Mumbai had shifted to Badlapur owing to low-cost housing and clean atmosphere. However, CR had not increased its services proportionately.""There's always a heavy rush of Pune-bound commuters. We need a third and fourth dedicated lane for express trains from Kalyan to Karjat. But the railway board has ignored our demands. Friday's incident is nothing but commuters' pent-up anger that finally exploded. If the issues are not sorted out, what happened at Diva could well be repeated at Badlapur,"" warned Advocate Godbole.Meanwhile, with over 21 local train ferries affected since morning and trains running from CST to Ambernath, most commuters travelled to Ambernath by taking an auto-rickshaw from Badlapur station.Sensing an opportunity, rickshaw-wallahs charged passengers Rs 200 instead of the usual Rs 20 for the Badlapur-Ambernath commute. Kalyan Dombivali Municipal Transport provided five city buses for the Kalyan-Badlapur ferry.",1

The announcement comes just ahead of the Lok Sabha poll dates being declared. As part of the agreement, the Railway Board will give 650 acres of its land at Re 1 per acre, and in turn, the Karnataka government will bear partial costs of doubling two lines, estimated to cost Rs 1,700 crore.In a joint press conference alongside Kumaraswamy, Goyal said the long-awaited rail network connecting 82 stations spread over 160 km costing Rs 23,000 crore will be completed in six years.Goyal said, “The ‘19’ conditions subject to which ‘in principle’ approval was given by Karnataka state cabinet will be ratified, as mutually agreed during the meeting today.”The CM also assured, “In next cabinet meeting of Government of Karnataka scheduled to be held on February 25, cabinet resolution will be passed on the same. GO to that extent will be communicated to Ministry of Railways for further taking up the project.”A statement from the Indian Railways further stated, “Minister of Railways agreed for granting railway land for the project at very nominal lease basis of Re.1 per acre, which will reduce the cost of project by about Rs.6700 crores, nearly by 30 %. Government of Karnataka agreed for unequivocal right of FSI ‘5’ on railway land to Indian Railway for financing of project.Government of Karnataka will approve the entire corridor without any curtailment. It is also agreed by Government of Karnataka will do cost sharing of two doubling projects Baiyyappanahalli-Hosur, Yesvantpur-Banaswadi-Hosur which was initially agreed and later disagreed upon by State Government.”As part of this project, the Kempegowda International Airport will also be connected to the city via the suburban rail system. Out of the 83 stations, 12 including Majestic will have intermodal connectivity with the Bengaluru Metro. The announcement comes after days of disagreement between the state and Centre over the cost sharing of the project. The Ministry of Railways had also expressed surprise at Karnataka increasing the length of the rail project to 360 km without prior intimation.The announcement was awaited as the Karnataka Chief Minister gave an in-principal nod to the project based on a  pre-feasibility report readied by the Rail India Technical and Economic Service (RITES) in January.",1

The seer was heading to Haridwar from Prayagraj (Allahabad). The driver is said to have slept while driving the SUV, which crashed into the truck ahead.UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath and BJP president Amit Shah condoled the demise of Hansdevacharya, who was the leader of the Bairagis campaigning for construction of a Ram temple in Ayodhya at the site where Babri Masjid existed.The mosque was demolished in December 1992 by karsevaks (volunteers) who had gathered in the UP town following a call given by Vishwa Hindu Parishad and supported by the Bharatiya Janata Party to push for construction of a Ram temple there. The VHP and the BJP have maintained that it was the place where Lord Ram was born.The Supreme Court is hearing the title suit in the matter after a judgment of the Allahabad High Court was challenged before it.

792,"Tragedies are becoming far too commonThe Indian Air Force can begin addressing the problem by being more transparent and releasing periodic reports on accidents and their causes.A still from a video footage shows an aircraft in flames after two aircrafts of IAF's aerobatic team Surya Kiran crashed near the Yelahanka airbase in Bengaluru, Feb 19, 2019(PTI)During the rehearsal for the Aero India show currently underway, two Hawk Mk 132 aircrafts collided resulting in the death of one pilot. The tragic news comes close on the heels of a Mirage 2000 crash on February 1, which led to loss of two pilots. A Jaguar crashed on January 28 and a Mig-27 crashed on February 12, thankfully without any loss of lives.The problem of crashes is not new for the Indian Air Force (IAF). The year 2018 saw a number of crashes involving Sukhoi, Jaguar and MIG planes. In fact, the number of accidents that IAF has had with MIGs — 482 in 40 years till 2012 — had earned the aircraft the dubious title of “flying coffin”. The infamy was immortalised in the iconic film Rang De Basanti in 2006.Why are IAF planes so accident prone? One, it is simply the problem of slow movement on defence modernisation. IAF is flush with ageing planes on their last legs. Chief Justice of India Ranjan Gogoi recently dismissed a plea asking for judicial enquiry into the February 1 Mirage crash claiming that the aircraft was very old and “bound to crash”.Two, IAF is known to make its pilots undergo intense and rigorous training. Such a practice puts immense strain on the limited number of aircraft, pilots and the support staff. Three, tardy maintenance and upgrade of some of these planes has also been an issue. IAF puts the blame on HAL, which indeed is running way behind the schedule on a number of projects including the Mirage 2000 upgrade.Four, IAF has to operate in harsh tropical weather which is quite demanding on its planes. Then there are problems such as bird strikes, which, some estimates suggest, are responsible for 10% of accidents. It should be noted that the government scrapped a Rs 250 crore tender for buying bird detection and monitoring radars in 2015.Perhaps, IAF can begin addressing the problem by being more transparent. An annual, or even a triennial, report on accidents and their causes would be a good way to start. Some individual cases may be embarrassing to the service, but an aggregate release of data would do much good simply by shining the light on deficiencies — and ensure that more of its brave pilots do not become casualties.",0
793,"Transformation of railways in NDA budgets Prime Minister Narendra Modi had promised to transform the railways before coming to power, and he has been on track. Though there's still a lot to be done, the railways have managed to shed the image of a state enterprise impervious to change and aloof to its customers' needs. A large number of new customer services has made the railways more customer-oriented while launch of faster trains and significant upgrades of existing ones have changed the look of the railways. In Railway Budget 2014, then railway minister Sadananda Gowda pitched for reforms by proposing private and foreign direct investment and public-private partnership to meet the resource crunch. He proposed the highest-ever plan outlay of Rs 65,445 crore. He also announced plans for introduction of a bullet train in Mumbai-Ahmedabad sector. ""We need huge investment for running bullet train. There was a ban on FDI in railways. Now we would request commerce ministry to delete that clause so that thethere can be FDI in infrastructure development,"" he said. At that time, the announcement did not excite many, but the ambitious project did begin within a few years with a loan from Japan. In Railway Budget 2015-16, the new minister Suresh Prabhu kept fares unchanged and eschewed populist gestures such as new trains and stations in his maiden budget, He preferring to bring a technocrat's focus to try and improve amenities for customers, set the organisation's trajectory for the next five years and put its derailed finances back on tracks. In a historic move, the government merged the railway budget with the general budget in 2017, ending a 92-year-old practice of a separate budget for the country’s largest transporter. The total proposed outlay for 2017-18 was Rs 1,31,000 crore, an 8 per cent increase from the 2016-17 budget. Finance Minister Arun Jaitley announced that a Rail Safety Fund will be created over a period of five years with a corpus of Rs 100,000 crore. He also announced that 500 stations would be made differentlyabled-friendly by providing lifts and escalators. He promised a new Metro Rail Policy with focus on innovative models of implementation and financing, and standardisation and indigenisation of hardware and software. Budget 2018-19 gave a big boost to railways with a capital expenditure of Rs 1.48 lakh crore. ""Most of this money will be spent on capacity expansion, since it is a priority for the national transporter,"" Jaitley said. He proposed a target of doubling 18,000 km of lines and said gauge conversion was underway to eliminate capacity constraints. The minister said 36,000 km of rail track renewal had been targeted in the coming year while 4,267 unmanned railway crossings on broad gauge routes were to be eliminated in the next two years ",1
794,"Trauma care key to cut accident deathsDelhi reported the highest number of fatal road crashes during 2017 with 1,584 deaths, according to the latest available data from the ministry of road transport and highways. In the same year, 6,673 accidents were reported from the city.The AIIMS trauma centre, one of the two level 1 trauma centres in Delhi, receives around 200 to 250 cases daily, the highest in the city. Of these, over 70% are victims of road crash.(Picture for representation)Delhi reported the highest number of fatal road crashes during 2017 with 1,584 deaths, according to the latest available data from the ministry of road transport and highways. In the same year, 6,673 accidents were reported from the city.“The number of traffic deaths in Delhi is high because of the high number of road accidents. And, the infrastructure and the enforcement of traffic rules, along with the pre-hospital care systems, are to blame,” said Dr Sanjeev Bhoi, professor of emergency medicine at Jai Prakash Narayan Apex Trauma Centre, All India Institute of Medical Sciences.The AIIMS trauma centre, one of the two level 1 trauma centres in Delhi, receives around 200 to 250 cases daily, the highest in the city. Of these, over 70% are victims of road crash.And, the numbers might be under-reported.“These numbers are gathered from the police cases registered and are likely to be under-reported. Sometimes patients die days after the case is registered and this may not get updated in the records,” said Dr Rakhi Dandona, who heads the Global Burden of Disease –Road Injuries group for the State-level Disease Burden initiative.At country level, the World Health Organisation’s Global Status Report on Road Safety 2018 estimated the number of traffic deaths to be 2,99,091 in 2016, which is nearly double the 1,50, 785 deaths reported in that year.Injuries to be wary ofMost accident victims suffer from poly-trauma — injuries to more than one system of the body. But it is the head injury that leads to the highest mortality and disability.“Of all the accident cases, almost 40% come in with severe head injuries. And, in such cases, even if the patient reaches hospital on time and receives the best care, 35% die within 48 hours.Of those that survive, half are left in a vegetative state and the rest experience some sort of cognitive deficit depending on what part of the brain is affected. No one is left unscathed. Wearing a simple helmet can reduce the number of head injuries,” Dr Bhoi said.Apart from head trauma, the second most fatal is excessive bleeding. “Around 30% accident victims come in a haemorrhagic shock caused by excessive bleeding. This can be prevented by using a tourniquet. Tying a piece of cloth tightly above the area that is bleeding can reduce the blood flow,” Dr Bhoi said.How to reduce mortalityThe best way to reduce mortality is to reduce the number of accidents, the experts say. For this, there is a need to plan cities better and to improve road infrastructure.“The first step is to ensure that there are no potholes, and there are appropriate speed breakers and signage. And, the authorities should be on the lookout for and fix black spots or areas where a lot of accidents are reported. The pavements need to be improved and the roads have to be made keeping in mind the pedestrians,” said Dr Nutan Mehta, head of the new emergency and trauma wing of Dr Ram Manohar Lohia hospital.Then comes following speed limits taking safety measures such as wearing helmets and putting on seat belts.A study at the AIIMS trauma centre found that only half of the two-wheeler users were wearing helmets, only 45% had fastened it properly, and only 38.5% were wearing a helmet approved as “crash proof” by the Bureau of Indian Standards.Only 32.4% people used seat belts, showed another study from AIIMS. This is because of lax enforcement, which is the key to ensure safe driving practices.“World over, there is enough evidence to suggest that awareness alone cannot ensure safe driving practices. There is a need for strict enforcement so that people face real consequences like licences being cancelled and actually not being able to drive after the licence is cancelled. But, we do not have enough manpower to ensure that all violators get punished,” Dr Dandona said.Poor vehicular standards are also to blame. “Most of the commonly used cars in India do not adhere to the international safety standards. The New Car Assessment Programme (NCAP), which looks at how likely a driver or passenger is of surviving a crash, shows that there are only two or three cars that have a four-star rating, a norm strictly followed in the West,” Dr Bhoi said. And, even if there is a crash, to ensure that a person survives there is a need for a strong pre-hospital and hospital care.“Currently, there aren’t enough trauma care hospitals in the country, which means valuable time is lost and the patient does not get appropriate care within the first “golden” hour of the crash when the chances of survival and minimum disability is the highest. The roads are such that it is also difficult for ambulance to reach an accident site and then take the patient to the hospital in time,” said Dr Dandona.People at riskPeople walking on the roads and those driving two-wheelers have the highest risk of severe injury in road crashes. In India, 40% of all road crash deaths were reported in motorised two and three-wheeler riders and 10% in pedestrians.“In India as in any developing countries, higher number of injuries and deaths are reported in two wheeler riders and pedestrians because of the traffic mix. We have high speed cars moving along with bikes, cycles and pedestrians on the roads. This is because missing or occupied pavements and cycles lanes and the attitude of the people as well,” Dr Dandona said.Also, men outnumber women when it comes to road crashes.A study of demographics of the victims of road crash in Delhi showed that 84% were men and just 16% were women. Besides, almost 50% of the victims belonged to the 16-30 age group.“These are the groups that are more likely to travel for work. The way we have developed the infrastructure of the city, people have to travel long distances to get to work. There are commercial hubs and residential hubs in Delhi. Ideally, people should be working in their neighbourhood. If that were the case, 90% of the people would be off roads in the city,” said Dr Mehta of RML hospital.People in a hurry also lead to a higher number of crashes. Of the 900 accident victims interviewed for a 2017 study, 54.2% reported that they were in a hurry to reach somewhere. The same study reported that 26.1% were having a conversation with co-rider or on a cell phone. Drivers using mobile phones are 4 times more likely to be involved in a crash, according to the World Health Organisation.",0

The IAF is now left with 48 Mirage 2000 fighters.Smoke billows from the wreckage of a Mirage 2000 aircraft which crashed in Bengaluru Friday morning.(ANI)Two pilots of the Indian Air Force (IAF) were killed on Friday after their Mirage 2000 fighter jet crashed during takeoff at the Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) airport here.The French-origin trainer aircraft, manufactured by Dassault Aviation, was on an acceptance sortie after being upgraded at HAL, an IAF spokesperson said in New Delhi. IAF has ordered a probe into the accident that comes four days after a Jaguar aircraft went down in Kushinagar, Uttar Pradesh.First inducted into IAF in 1984, Friday’s crash was the 11th accident involving the Mirage 2000 fleet. The IAF is now left with 48 Mirage 2000 fighters.HAL identified the two pilots as squadron leaders Samir Abrol and Siddartha Negi.Commissioned into IAF in June 2008, Abrol, 33, was from Ghaziabad. Negi, 31, hailed from Dehradun and joined IAF in June 2009.“HAL regrets to inform that one upgraded Mirage 2000 aircraft crashed during the customer acceptance flight at HAL airport here today [Friday] around 10.30 am,” the state-owned plane maker said in a statement.Officials said that the pilots had ejected from the plane but landed on its wreckage.Minutes after the crash, residents from nearby areas posted videos and images of the accident site on social media. The flight data recorder has been recovered from the site.India had in 2011 signed a $2.4-billion contract with Dassault Aviation and Thales to upgrade 51 Mirage 2000 fighters with new weapons, radars and avionics. The first two aircraft were upgraded by the firms in France followed by another two at HAL in Bengaluru. HAL is upgrading the remaining planes.The fighter that crashed was upgraded at HAL, said an official who did not want to be identified.The crash couldn’t have come at a worse time for HAL, as questions have been raised about the capabilities of the state-owned company that is going through financial trouble.Several HAL projects are running years behind schedule, including the Mirage 2000 upgrade programme, much to IAF’s dismay.The Mirage 2000 upgrade is five years behind schedule.IAF’s efforts to support HAL have affected its fighting capabilities, air force chief Air Chief Marshal BS Dhanoa said on Thursday. Speaking at a conference at the Centre for Air Power Studies in New Delhi, he was responding to criticism about IAF’s alleged dislike for the HAL-made Tejas light combat aircraft.Since Independence, 17 test pilots and engineers have lost their lives in air accidents during the testing and evaluation of indigenous planes such as Marut, Kiran, Ajeet, Saras and AWACS (airborne warning and control systems) prototype aircraft.",0

798,"Two striking examples of BMC inefficiency in 1 dayThis week, the newly restored Flora Fountain developed a leak within a couple of days of its inauguration and a short distance away large chunk of Marine Drive caved inThis week, Mumbai woke up to two fine examples of how well the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) runs the city. The newly restored fountain at Hutatma Chowk developed a leak within a couple of days of its inauguration. And a short distance away, a fairly large chunk of Marine Drive, Mumbai’s most famous and iconic promenade, caved in near the crossing where this road turns towards Churchgate station.The general understanding in Mumbai is that no matter what happens elsewhere, Marine Drive is among those areas — Malabar Hill, Breach Candy, Peddar Road, Carmichael Road, Altamount Road, Napean Sea Road being some others — that are very well looked after.The crème de la crème of Mumbai resides in these areas as well as the most powerful, among them leading politicians, bureaucrats, BMC officials and police chiefs. Maintaining these areas hassle-free is not a new development. It has been so historically.Among these, Marine Drive enjoys prime of place. This is the road that gives the city so much of its aesthetic beauty, glamour and character, starting from the outer edge of Girgaum Chowpatty and leading up to the southern end where the Gateway of India stands, taking in its sweep Nariman Point and Mantralaya, where the state’s seat of power is located.How could anything go wrong on this road one might ask? Well, what excellent evidence to the contrary. Or perhaps this is democracy at work, where every area is treated equally badly!And as for Flora Fountain’s short-lived rejuvenation, it makes it easier to understand why we have pipes that don’t take water where most badly needed and waste it elsewhere.If these mishaps were not so serious, it would be almost comical. That this should happen in the country’s leading city, in prime locations and both of them so close to the BMC headquarters, is the deep irony. What hope then for other, less prominent areas?The Marine Drive cave-in was fortunately anticipated in the nick of time, preventing accidents and casualties. What if one or a couple of cars were travelling over the part where the road caved in, it could have led to a monumental tragedy.Flora Fountain’s malfunction was not a threat to life, but was a setback nonetheless and stymied months of effort at reviving one of the city’s major landmarks.It becomes particularly galling when you consider that the BMC is the richest civic body in the country. Its annual budget is in excess of ?27,000 crore, so resources for development, maintenance and repairs can hardly be the issue.Why then should such things occur — or recur — considering that there had been a cave-in on Marine Drive a few years earlier too?The problem lies in the lack of proper planning and detailing of such work that is undertaken – as seems to be the case in the Marine Drive road collapse, as well as callous disregard for completing the ‘last mile’ diligently, as the Flora Fountain setback highlights.Authorities associated with both these projects have been at pains to highlight what has gone wrong. But their explanations don’t wash because all these should have been factored in, leaving zero scope for the trouble that has been witnessed.Accidents can happen and always come unannounced. It is the preparedness for such eventualities that matters.This is where the civic body has been utterly incompetent, for there have been several instances in the past where this has showed up.A diatribe against the BMC, however, is not the purpose of this column, nor is that of much help. A great deal has already been written about the efficiency or otherwise of the corporation. More words will be wasted.Whether the corporation will wake up now, after the recent problems is moot.The more pertinent question is whether citizens will wake up, say enough is enough, and demand stringent accountability.",0
799,"Two, 3-wheeler riders worst hit: WHOThe actual number of deaths, however, could be higher as per the report, which estimates that there were 2.99 lakh traffic fatalities. This means, an estimated 22.6 people per 100,000 population died of traffic accidents in India in 2016.Two and three-wheeler riders accounted for 40% of all traffic deaths in India in 2016, according to WHO’s Global Status Report on Road Safety 2018, which puts the total traffic deaths at 1.5 lakh that year.The actual number of deaths, however, could be higher as per the report, which estimates that there were 2.99 lakh traffic fatalities. This means, an estimated 22.6 people per 100,000 population died of traffic accidents in India in 2016.“The highest number of casualties are reported among people on two and three wheelers, and let me add pedestrians, because they do not have a protective exterior exposing them to more injuries. Also, the kind of speed and traffic mix in India means that cars with higher speed limits drive on the same road with two-wheelers with lower speed limit, making them more accident prone,” said Dr Rakhi Dandona who heads the Global Burden of Disease –Road Injuries group for the State-level Disease Burden initiative.Globally, 1.35 million people died in traffic crashes the same year.“The report shows that progress has been achieved in important areas such as legislation, vehicle standards and improving access to post-crash care. This progress has not, however, occurred at a pace fast enough. At this rate, the Sustainable Development Goal to halve road traffic deaths by 2020 will not be met,” the report stated.The estimated number of traffic fatalities is almost double, according to the World Health Organisation Report, which puts the absolute number of deaths at 2.99 lakhs. In 2016, 22.6 people in every 100,000 population died in traffic crashes.After two and three-wheeler, the highest number of deaths were reported in passengers of cars (12%), drivers and passengers of heavy trucks (11%), and pedestrians (10%) after deaths in two and three wheeler drivers.Looking at the factors leading to fatalities, the report found that India meets “two to six” international vehicle safety standards. The limit on blood alcohol concentration as per the law in India is 0.03 g/dl. Reducing blood alcohol concentrations from 0.1 g/dl to 0.05 g/dl may contribute to reduction in alcohol related road traffic fatalities by 6 - 18%, the report states.However, the maximum speed limit on urban and rural roads in India is 100 kmph. This is much higher than the speed of 50 kmph or less the report was looking at. “A 5% reduction in speed can reduce the number of fatalities by 30%,” it said.“There is a need to take a multi-sectoral approach to tackle road crashes and deaths. There has to better infrastructure that allows for safer travel, better vehicles, improved intervention and enforcement of laws, and a health system that can take care of accident victims. We need to look at the problem from a health perspective. Why should it be under the ministry of road transport and highways?” said Dr Dandona.India is the fourth-largest vehicle producer in the world.",0
800,"Two-year-old survives Audi-dumper crash in Delhi that killed his parents, grandmotherThree members of the Singhal family - Sumit Singhal, his wife Ruchi and his mother - were killed when a dumper truck overturned on their Audi car in in outer Delhi’s Rohini in the early hours of Wednesday.Passers-by look at the mangled remains of an Audi car which collided with a dumper at Rohini, in New Delhi, Wednesday, Feb. 20, 2019, killing three of the four occupants of the car. (PTI)When Sonu saw a dumper truck topple on top of an Audi in outer Delhi’s Rohini in the early hours of Wednesday, he didn’t believe that there would be any survivors in the car. An hour later though, he believes he witnessed a “miracle”.The three adult occupants of the car were crushed to death, but a two-year-old child was rescued with minor injuries. “Hundreds of us had gathered at the spot, but we were helpless. There was no way we could have pulled anyone out of the car. The truck and the soil it was carrying were too heavy for us,” said Sonu, who sleeps on the roadside and sells black salt on a cart.“We thought all inside the car were dead, but then, we heard the cries of a child and we were desperate to help the child,” Sonu said.According to Anurag (goes by a single name), a friend of the Singhal family that was involved in the mishap, a crane arrived about an hour later. The truck was removed and the car’s occupants were taken out of the mangled remains of the vehicle. “Only the child was alive. The others looked dead,” Anurag said.Anurag happened to be at the spot as he was among several residents from the neighbourhood in Rohini Sector 15 who were returning from a wedding in Gurugram. “We were in Gurugram to attend the wedding of the daughter of our former neighbour, Rajesh Goyal. The Singhal family was among the attendees,” Anurag said.Anurag reached the accident spot just moments after the mishap. “The child survived because he was sleeping on the rear seat. The car’s roof probably did not crush him,” Anurag said.The child’s parents, Sumit Singhal and Ruchi Singhal, got married over three years ago. They lived with Sumit’s parents and his younger sister in their five-storey home in Rohini Sector 15. The family had rented out some floors, and also had a thriving pulses processing unit in Bawana.Overloading menaceAs most of the soil being carried by the dumper had landed on the road and the Audi, police said they are not in a position to determine if the “offending vehicle” was overloaded.But investigators said it was possible that the dumper was overloaded. “The truck must have been going at a high speed, and the load it was carrying may have caused it to topple over,” a senior police officer said.According to data from the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways, the menace of overloading in goods vehicles has resulted in 817 mishaps and cost 141 lives in Delhi between 2015 and 2017.At the national level, overloading has been cited as the trigger for 1,94,153 mishaps and 67,349 deaths in the three years between 2015 and 2017. In that period, these mishaps accounted for anywhere between 11.9% and 15.4% of all accidents in India. In terms of deaths, overloading accounted for around 15% of all fatalities.Alok Kumar, joint commissioner of police (Delhi traffic police), said his personnel cannot prosecute goods vehicles for overloading. “We do not have the facility for weighing trucks and their goods because of which we cannot determine if they are overloaded,” the JCP said.",0

The STF busted the mass copying racket during the UP Board examination of physics paper.Police recovered Rs 12.50 lakh cash, solved answer sheets, fake identity cards of 12 invigilators, who were doing duty illegally. Besides, two pistols, 80 bullets, 16 mobile phones, 31 bank passbooks, four physics books, carbon papers and a SUV, from their possession.The STF arrested Yogendra Pal Singh, a school principal and centre superintendent, 12 fake invigilators including one from Haridwar, two solvers, one clerk and a teacher who was the mastermind behind the racket.The mass copying gang was operating at Janata Inter College, Muzaffarnagar and hired solvers from Delhi, Haryana and Uttarakhand were found taking the exam illegally, said police. According to STF, most of the invigilators were not regular teachers. They were hired by the centre superintendent to facilitate copying. These invigilators were teachers of physics, the subject for which the exam was on. This is a clear violation of exam rulebook that mandates that non subject teachers can only be made invigilator.SSP STF Abhishek Singh said as examination was being conducted under CCTV camera vigil and these invigilators were found dictating answer from outside the classroom. A team of STF led by Vimal Gautam along with DIoS Muzaffarnagar raided Janta Inter College and arrested many persons.Singh said after quizzing various people it came to light that one Intekab is the mastermind of the gang. After being interrogated, he revealed that he had large network of copying gang in bordering states of UP like Delhi, Haryana and Uttarakhand.“To help students pass the examination, the gang charges something between Rs 25,000 to Rs 55,000 from each student. Every year nearly 2000 students approach this gang to help them pass the examination. In return the gang makes about Rs 7-8 crore in exam,” SSP STF claimed.SSP, STF, said the teachers were caught solving the exam papers in the laboratory. They were using carbon papers to write multiple copies. They were dictating answers in such a way that CCTV cameras were unable to catch them.",0

808,"24th February 2010: When Sachin Tendulkar rewrote history books in GwaliorSachin Tendulkar is widely regarded as one of the best batsmen in the history of the game and on this day, nine years ago, the Indian superstar etched his name in history books against South Africa in Gwalior.Tendulkar became the first cricketer ever to score a double century in ODIs as he powered the hosts to a series-clinching win over the Proteas at the Captain Roop Singh Stadium.Riding on Tendulkar’s unbeaten 200, India put on a huge total of 401/3 in 50 overs. Depite AB De Villiers’101 ball 114, the visitors were dismissed for just 248 and they fell short by 153 runs.The Master Blaster’s innings included 25 boundaries and three massive sixes and he crossed the 200-run mark off just 147 deliveries at a healthy strike rate of 136.0.Tendulkar was rightly adjudged the man of the match as he showed the way to other that crossing the 200-run mark in ODIs was possible. Following Tendulkar’s heroics, many others took the leaf out of his book and went on to smash double centuries in the 50-over format of the game.India has most representation in this exclusive club as current vice-captain Rohit Sharma has done it thrice during the course of his illustrious career. Rohit’s 264 against Sri Lanka in Kolkata in 2014 also remains the highest individual score in ODIs.Apart from Tendulkar and Rohit, Virender Sehwag is the third Indian on this elite list as he smashed 219 against Windies in Indore in 2011.The other such cricketers are New Zealand’s Martin Guptill (237* vs WI), West Indies’ Chris Gayle (215 vs ZIM) and Pakistan’s Fakhar Zaman (210* vs ZIM).",0

The Government Railway Police (GRP) along with their counterparts at the Railway Protection Force (RPF) recently conducted a security audit of the stations, which revealed that there are at least 1090 unsecured spots between CSTM-Thane-Panvel and Churchgate-Bandra that need quick attention, according to Niket Kaushik, Commissioner, Government Railway Police (GRP).   Owing to heavy and uncontrolled footfall at the railway stations, the ‘minimum standard security’ apparatus continues to be compromised as all the stations have unauthorised entry and exit points. This makes all the stations unsafe and the railways have been informed to plug them, however, very little has been done.  The highest number of vulnerable points, 315, was found in Vashi GRP’s Thane-Vashi trans-harbour line, which is last on the list of security. “The audit is still underway and is being conducted by all the 17 police stations in Mumbai’s suburban section. The data will help to analyse the loopholes and improved coordination among the agencies and police. The concerned agencies (railways and BMC) are being informed about the findings for improving things on ground,” said Niket Kaushik, GRP commissioner.",1

US and North Korean negotiators have reached in advance and hammering out outcomes, if any, that could include the two countries exchanging liaison offices.Trump and Kim will hold multiple meetings, following the Singapore template from last summer, their first summit — a one-on-one, then one with their officials and a lunch, US officials have said.“We both expect a continuation of the progress made at first Summit in Singapore,” Trump wrote on Twitter Sunday.“Denuclearization?” he ended that post with a question mark.Also read | ‘Very, very bad situation between India and Pakistan’: Trump on Pulwama attackBut did not provide an answer. He went on, instead, reprise for North Korea the prospect of economic prosperity in exchange for giving up its nuclear weapons programme: “Chairman Kim realizes, perhaps better than anyone else, that without nuclear weapons, his country could fast become one of the great economic powers anywhere in the World. Because of its location and people (and him), it has more potential for rapid growth than any other nation!”Complete and verifiable denuclearization by North Korea is the key US goal but experts and US intelligence officials insist Pyongyang has not even made a start yet, though they agree it has also not conducted nuclear and missile tests since the two sides began talking earlier 2018, leading up to the June summit.North Korea is seeking, in return, a peace treaty to formally end the Korean war to replace the 1953 armistice, lifting of economic sanctions, and security guarantees. Kim hasn’t managed any of that yet yet, but his June meeting with Trump has given him a leg up over his father and grandfather, who ruled the country before him, as the first North Korean leader to meet a sitting American president.",0

(PTI Photo)The Indian Air Force (IAF) on Wednesday conducted a memorial fly-past at the Yelahanka air base for Wing Commander Sahil Gandhi, a day after the fighter pilot was killed in a mid-air collision between two British-origin Hawk advanced jet trainers while practising aerobatic manoeuvres for the five-day Aero India-2019.Three IAF fighter jets — a Sukhoi-30 fighter flanked by a Jaguar and a Tejas light combat aircraft — flew the time-honoured “missing man” formation to honour Gandhi at the inaugural fly-past of Asia’s biggest air show.“The formation pays tribute to the fallen pilot. If he was alive, he would have been flying too in the finger four formation,” said former IAF chief Air Chief Marshal Fali Major.Gandhi, 37, was part of the IAF’s renowned Surya Kiran Aerobatic Team (SKAT), which consists of the country’s finest pilots trained to perform complex stunts. Two other pilots injured in the twin Hawk crash - Wing Commander VT Shelke and Squadron Leader TJ Singh - are recuperating in an IAF hospital.A Rafale aircraft of the French air force also made a low pass during the flying display as a mark of respect to Gandhi, who hailed from Haryana’s Hisar. A radio call given by the French pilot announcing this was broadcast over the PA system on the ground. Captain Nativel Babouc, who flew the Rafale in a low pass to honour Gandhi, said, “It was my way to pay homage to the fallen pilot. We fighter pilots are one big family no matter which country we come from.”IAF chief Air Chief Marshal BS Dhanoa said it was too early to say what went wrong and only an investigation would reveal the cause of the accident. The jets were in a mirror manoeuvre – one flying inverted above the other – seconds before the collision that has become the major talking point at the 12th edition of the air show. While SKAT is not taking part in the air show any longer because IAF wants to pinpoint the reasons for the accident, the display team’s Hawks were seen parked outside an apron near the main runway of the air base.Defence minister Nirmala Sitharaman declared the air show open, asserting that it intended to put India on the global map as “a runway to a billion opportunities”.The IAF’s Sarang helicopter display team performed a string of breathtaking manoeuvres amid cheers and applause from the spectators, including ministers from foreign countries, and top military officials including the three service chiefs.Another highlight of the biennial show was a fly-by performed by a B-52 Stratofortress bomber that came from the Andersen Air Force Base in Guam.Of the seven fighter jets competing for an Indian programme to build 114 planes locally under the strategic partnership (SP) model, only Rafales, F-18s and F-16s were part of the flying display.",0

On Thursday, the Congress cited media reports to allege that Modi continued shooting for a film in the Corbett National Park on February 14 for “self propagation”, and stayed put till the evening despite the attack on a CRPF convoy in south Kashmir’s Pulwama district in the afternoon that day.Congress’ chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala, addressing a press conference, also claimed the prime minister continued to “have tea and samosas at seven o’clock in a PWD guest house when every single Indian household didn’t eat food (that day)”.",0
814,"‘Sabka vinaash’: Yogi Adityanath’s take on SP, BSP, and Congress in UPUttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath has said while the BJP’s motto was “Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas”, the opposition SP, BSP and the Congress in the state stood for “Sabka Vinaash” (destruction of everyone).His comments came when a discussion on the budget was underway at the Uttar Pradesh Legislative Assembly.“SABKA stands for SP (Samajwadi Party), BSP (Bahujan Samaj Party) and Congress. Our Sabka slogan speaks about development of all. Their Sabka speaks about destruction of everyone...We stand for Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikaas. Yours is Sabka Saath, Sabka Vinaash,” Adityanath said intervening the discussion.Taking a dig at the Congress, he said, “Every citizen of this country is proud of our traditions. If the Congress had tried to take pride in the country’s traditions, it would not have come to its lowest tally in the state and the country. This situation has come as the Congress had insulted the culture and traditions of the country.” “When you want to garner votes, you show your janeu (sacred threads worn by Hindus). People have even started telling their ‘Gotra’ (sub-caste)... And even the SP did not find the Congress suitable to include it in the SP-BSP alliance,” the chief minister said, targeting the opposition Congress in the state.Adityanath also took a jibe at Ram Gobind Chaudhary (SP), the Leader of Opposition in the UP Assembly. “If you (Ram Gobind Chaudhary) had even an iota of sympathy for the poor, you would have been with Shivpal Yadav’s political party and not with the SP. (Ram Manohar) Lohiaji had spoken about socialism, which is not seen in your party (SP). In reality, it is Shivpal Yadav who takes the name of Lohiaji. You (SP) people do not take his name,” he said.He briefed the House on the various aspects of the budget and spoke at length on the various schemes of the state government pertaining to women, girls, farmers, labourers, youth, villages, electricity, roads, Metro rail, development of airports, health and education.“In a nutshell, I can say that this is a holistic budget. This is a budget which has taken care of the interests of all sections of the society and has given a new impetus to development. This is a budget which has brought smile and prosperity on every face,” Adityanath said.He announced that the state government will soon enhance the honorarium of Anganwadi and ASHA workers, those in the Panchayati Raj Department, village sevaks and cooks who make mid-day meals.Speaking on the recent terror attack in Pulwama that claimed the lives of 40 CRPF personnel, Adityanath said, “The anger which is visible after the Pulwama terror attack is an eye-opener for the public representatives. If a person indulges in appeasement of self-interest, and encourages terrorism, then the same anger will be visible which is today seen on the streets.”The UP chief minister said the BJP government has worked hard to put the derailed system of the state back on track.“UP, which was languishing among the bottom states of the country during the governments of the SP and the BSP, is now on the path of becoming the number one,” Adityanath said.",0

We do not want to be an elitist company. That’s not -- we want to be an egalitarian company and we’ve got a lot of work going on in developing markets,” Williams was quoted as saying in a Burlington Times News report late on Sunday.During his speech, Williams discussed several topics, including the rising cost of the Apple products and inaccuracy of analyst cost estimates.“The stories that come out about the cost of our products (have been) the bane of my existence from the beginning of time, including our early days.“Analysts don’t really understand the cost of what we do and how much care we put into making our products,” he told students.Citing Apple Watch as an example, the tech giant COO said the company “built an entire physiology lab with 40 licensed nurses and enlisted the help of 10,000 participants to further study how calories are burned in various fitness exercises”.According to Apple CEO Tim Cook, there are several factors why iPhone sales are not picking up in the emerging markets.“The customers are holding on to their older iPhones a bit longer than in the past. When you pair this with the macroeconomic factors, particularly in emerging markets, it resulted in iPhone revenue that was down 15 per cent from last year,” Cook told analysts recently.Analysts say they expect some kind of price correction going forward as Apple has given indications that they will look at pricing outside the US closely now.",0

Four of the sixes came off Kevin O’Brien in the 17th over which reaped 28 runs in all.One giant hit off Shane Gelkate went over the stands and out of the ground.Zazai’s stocks have risen dramatically despite missing a place in the Indian Premier League this season.In October, he became only the third batsman to hit six sixes in a T20 over for his Afghanistan Premier League side Kabul Zwanan.He equalled the record for the fastest T20 half century in 12 balls in the same match.Stirling hardly knew who to throw into the breach as a bowler.Boyd Rankin finally claimed a wicket for the Irish when Ghani -- who made 73 off 43 balls -- played a careless shot over long-on that Joshua Little caught diving as he ran in from the boundary.While Stirling and Kevin O’Brien were no slouches, they never kept up with the mountainous run rate, which had risen to 17 by the 10th over.Afghanistan’s star bowler Rashid Khan came on for the 11th over and was furious when captain Asghar Afghan spilled a relatively simple catch off his first ball to give O’Brien a chance with Ireland on 109.O’Brien was bowled in the next over by Fareed Ahmad for a 37 which included two sixes.Rashid bowled Andy Balbirnie in the following over for two and Stirling started to run out of reliable partners.Mujeeb Ur Rahman claimed Stirling -- who as a consolation made Ireland’s top T20 score of 91 off 50 balls -- when he was caught by replacement Najeeb Tarakai on the boundary.The final match of the series is on Sunday. The two play five one-day internationals from February 28 and a one-off Test in March.",0

However, at a joint press conference called by the UD ministry, Delhi Metro and Reliance Infrastructure on Monday, the differences between the agencies emerged.Sudhir Krishna, secretary, urban development ministry, said, “There were no defects in the civil construction when the service on the line started in February 2010.” Sumit Banerjee, CEO (infrastructure), Reliance Infrastructure, countered: “There were damages since day one but they went unnoticed. They came to light during our recent annual inspection.”Meanwhile, the urban development ministry has ordered a proper examination. “Since the magnitude of damage is quite high, it has been ordered to examine all 2,100 bearings,” Krishna said.The ministry and the Railway board have formed a two-member inquiry committee to identify the responsible person/s or agency and investigate in details. As repair of these defects is likely to take a long time, the August deadline for the re-opening of the high-speed line will be missed, officials said.

The Trinamool Congress and the DMK, both of whom have to face assembly elections next year, had to do some shadow boxing so as not to be seen as openly supporting the increase.The opposition, including the Left and the BJP, predictably, went all out to attack the government, demanding a rollback and blaming it for further stoking inflation.Food inflation on Thursday rose marginally to 16.96 per cent from 16.12 per cent last week.For the Trinamool and the DMK, it was a delicate balancing act.Railway Minister Mamata Banerjee stayed away from the meeting of the Empowered Group of Ministers though the increase of diesel prices would directly impact her ministry. Railway ministry officials, however, said that although the the fuel hike would increase its expense on diesel by Rs 470 crore, passenger fares will remain untouched.Fertiliser and Chemical Minister M.K. Alagiri simply read out a note to say that the hike would push up prices of other items further. “Any further increase will hit the purchasing power of the lower middle income families,” he said.When he even proposed a rollback, Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee snapped: “What rollback?” Alagiri fell silent.Banerjee said later, “I am unhappy and we do not support the hike.” But she clarified, “We do not want to quarrel as it won’t look nice. I will talk to the government to reconsider”.The government did consult allies on Thursday before taking the decision.Petroleum Minister Murli Deora spoke to DMK’s A. Raja and Mukherjee had an hour-long discussion with Banerjee. The Trinamool leader made it clear that she will not attend the EgoM as it could send a wrong signal to her electorate.At Friday’s meeting, Agriculture Minister and NCP chief Sharad Pawar said that if the government wanted a hike it must not dither on it. “If God is willing, prices will come down in future.”The Congress was on the defensive. “The government must have been constrained to take this step,” said spokesperson Jayanthi Natarajan.Privately many Congress workers expressed their unhappiness with the hike that is being seen as hurting the aam aadmi.The BJP demanded that the taxes should be rationalised to make fuel cheaper and dismissed the government’s defence that it was the NDA that had started to dismantle the administered pricing mechanism first.",1

The chief minister’s offer came a day after Puri said the Delhi government will have to pay Rs 3,000 crore annually for five years to put off the metro fare hike, set to be implemented from Tuesday.

The report, published in thewire.in, said Shah’s company Temple Enterprises Pvt Limited was “engaged in negligible activity” in the financial years ending March 2013 and 2014 but “jumped to a turnover of Rs 80.5 crore in 2015-16”. The company had taken an unsecured loan during the year for Rs 15.78 crore, the news report said, adding that it finally wound up in October 2016 after posting a loss. Jay Shah issued a statement saying the article “makes false, derogatory and defamatory imputation against me by creating in the minds of right thinking people an impression that my business owes its ‘success’ to my father Sri Amit Bhai Shah’s political position.” Read the story here.Send your child to school or be locked up in jail with no food, water: UP ministerUttar Pradesh minister Om Prakash Rajbhar has warned that parents who fail to send their wards to schools will be locked up in police stations without food and water.

In an unprecedented move, the ministry has brought to an end a 36-year-old protocol where it was mandatory for general managers to present themselves on arrival and departure of the Railway Board chairman and other board members during zonal visits. As part of a massive overhaul of the culture of privilege prevalent in the ministry, the Railway Board has decided to do away with the instructions of a 1981 circular that mandated such protocol.

May and leading lights in the Conservative Party took to the print media on Sunday to warn of unrest paving the way for Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn into Downing Street. May appeared to have survived another threat to her leadership after a bid to oust her by former party chairman Grant Shapps collapsed when it did not find much support among party MPs.

After the win in Ranchi in the first T20 of the three-match series, Virat Kohli-led side can very well hope for another series triumph against the team from Down Under. The dominance of the Virat Kohli-led side in the past few months has shown its potential to be one of the greatest Indian sides ever. It very well reminds of the MS Dhoni-led Indian team that dominated world cricket a little while back. Even reaching the heights of Steve Smith or Ricky Ponting-led Australian cricket teams is no longer a distant dream, it seems. “In the current era there are many teams who are almost at par. So, it would be great if we achieve the same results now, what Australia did in old days,” Dhawan, who remained unbeaten on 15 in India’s nine-wicket win in the first T20I, said.

It has become a victim of coalition politics in both UPA-I and UPA-II. The ministry has become an orphan and is surviving without any protection or guidance,"" BJP spokesperson Jagat Prakash Nadda said.The party, led by its president Nitin Gadkari, condoled the death of over 60 people due to derailment of Kalka mail at Fatehpur in Uttar Pradesh on Sunday.Nadda held Prime Minister, who has kept the Railways portfolio with himself since Mamata Banerjee resigned to become chief minister of West Bengal, responsible for the poor state of affairs in the ministry.""The Prime Minister is squarely responsible for this... It is his weakness that he never intervened when Lalu Prasad and Mamata Banerjee were running the ministry,"" he said.He alleged that the UPA government was ""insensitive"" and warned that ""passing the buck"" will not do.Nadda also blamed former railway ministers Mamata Banerjee and Lalu Prasad for the problems being faced by Indian Railways today.""As Railway Minister in UPA-I, Prasad had made tall claims of profits and given wrong figures. He also projected himself as a management guru at that time. Mamata Banerjee, who succeeded him, deflated his tall claims. But this ministry has now become a joke which is unbearable,"" Nadda said.Referring to the recommendations of the HR Khanna committee, appointed by the NDA government to study rail safety and other issues, Nadda asked why it was shelved.""In 2002-03, the Khanna Committee had recommended a Rail Safety Fund with a corpus of Rs 15,000 crore. The Atal Bihari Vajpayee government had sanctioned Rs 17,000 crore after factoring in inflation,"" he said.Enumerating other achievements of the Railway ministry during the erstwhile NDA government, the BJP spokesperson maintained that 17,000 km of rail track renewal, building of 3,000 rail bridges, upgrading of signals at 950 stations and improvement in security and other policy matters were approved by the Vajpayee regime.He alleged that all these projects were abandoned by the ministry once Lalu Prasad took charge. He further accused Banerjee of contributing her bit to the deterioration of the ministry.""The Railway Ministry migrated to Kolkata during Mamata Banerjee's time. She had a Vision 2020 but we all know her vision right from the time she took office was something else,"" Nadda said, alluding to Banerjee's aim of becoming the chief minister of West Bengal during her tenure as railway minister.The BJP General Secretary said Sunday's accident was a result of lack of long term planning by the ministry.""The Minister of state for railways (Mukul Roy) was not ready to go to the site of the accident. He had to be told by the Prime Minister to go. Railways is suffering due to coalition compulsions. No monitoring of projects is being done. One lakh posts of traffic and security personnel are lying vacant. Political will is needed,"" Nadda said.In his condolence message, Gadkari said the government did not take immediate steps to improve rail safety and the situation deteriorated further. He urged the government to take prompt and effective steps for the safety of people.",1

So what is the harm in paying for a service that will be available on their mobile phone,” said a senior railway official, requesting anonymity.The mobile ticketing for suburban trains was first announced in the 2014-15 interim budget presented in February 2014. However, the project didn’t take off until July — its original deadline.With this service, commuters will be able to book tickets and renew seasonal passes on their mobile. Each commuter will receive a code via SMS after booking the ticket and the money will be deducted from their mobile wallet, which they have to create with the railways.Railway officials are also in the process of creating an interface with banks where the ticket amount can be also deducted through internet banking.The commuter has to insert this SMS code into an Automatic Ticket Vending Machine (ATVM) and procure the printed ticket. The service will initially be available at five stations on the Western Railway (WR) and Central Railway (CR), respectively.On CR, the service will be available at Kalyan, Kurla, Dadar, CST and Thane stations, while Churchgate, Bandra, Dadar, Andheri and Borivli on the WR will have the service.Gradually, these ATVMs will be installed at all stations, said the railway official.Commuter activists, however, claimed the additional charges are not justified.“Railways are not incurring much cost to provide the service. Rather, they should consistently increase the fare and invest in better rail infrastructure and new projects,” said Ashok Datar, transport expert.",1

Roads And Railways ProjectsBy Accommodation Times News ServiceThe Centre gave its green signal for investments worth more than Rs.27,000 crore in new highways and railway lines across the country to boost economic growth.The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) approved infrastructure projects worth Rs.27, 328 crore for expansion of railway lines in 11 states and development of 1,120 km national highways in five states.“The Cabinet decisions are a continuation of the government’s commitment to support infrastructure development particularly expanding the national highways beyond the existing ones,” said Manish Agarwal, partner and leader, infrastructure, PwC India. “This will augur well for passenger and freight movement and is very positive for the infrastructure sector, he said.Infrastructure boostThe government plans to increase its investments in the infrastructure sector. About 8,300 kilometres of roads involving more than Rs.1 lakh crore investments were revived, said Finance Minister Arun Jaitley in his Budget speech. Total investments earmarked in the current fiscal for roads and railways sectors amounts to Rs.2.18 lakh crore. The Centre is also augmenting port capacity by developing greenfield projects in both eastern and western coasts. In the aviation sector, the Centre plans to revive torpid airports.The railway expansion programme includes nine projects involving 1,937 km of track construction at an estimated cost of Rs.20, 867 crore. The projects include construction of second railway line between New Bongaigaon and Kamakhya in Assam. The government also gave its approval to build third and fourth railway line projects on the North South and East West Corridors of the Golden Quadrilateral.The Railway Ministry said the “fully saturated” Golden Quadrilateral will get a “big boost” helping in transportation of coal, minerals, steel and other commodities. This will also enable transportation of more passengers along these routes.“At present, the number of passengers and goods trains in the Golden Quadrilateral section is far more than its capacity resulting in heavy detention. These projects are essentially required for removing capacity constraints, reducing detention and for traffic growth,” the Railway Ministry said.Among the projects approved are third railway lines between Kharagpur and Adityapur (Jharkhand), Itarsi and Nagpur (Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra), Ballarshah and Kazipet (Maharashtra and Telangana) and Vijayawada and Gudur (Andhra Pradesh).Similar third railway lines will also be built between Rajnandgaon-Nagpur (Kalumna) in Chhattisgarh and Gondia, Bhandara and Nagpur Districts of Maharashtra, Mathura and Jhansi and Jhansi and Bina in Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh.Besides, the CCEA has also given its nod to construction of fourth railway line between Jharsuguda and Bilaspur (Odisha and Chattisgarh). The construction of these railway lines is expected to be completed in four to six years.Highway connectivityAs a part of the National Highways Interconnectivity Improvement Project (NHIIP), the government approved constructing 1,120 km national highways in Karnataka, Odisha, Bihar, Rajasthan and West Bengal with World Bank assistance. The work is scheduled to be completed by July 2024 at an estimated cost of Rs.6, 461 crore.These projects will ensure safe, fast and all weather movement of traffic on the proposed national highways mostly located in backward regions thereby improving socio-economic development, an official statement said. In a separate move, the CCEA has also approved waiver of penal interest on the Government of India loans availed by Cochin Port Trust to the tune of Rs.897 crore. The Cochin Port Trust had availed Rs.168 crore worth loans between 1936-37 and 1994-95 for various development activities from the Centre. Non-payment of loans had attracted penal interest of Rs.914 crore, according to an official statement.The Cabinet also approved leasing out 4,060 square metres of Airports Authority of India (AAI) land to Assam Industrial Development Corporation (AIDC) for setting up Centre for Perishable Cargo and its future expansion at the Guwahati Airport.",1
835,"Can we repair the train while it is running?Indian trains run at an average speed of 50-70km per hour — fairly low when compared to the trains in developed countries. Yet, train accidents in India are phenomenally higher in comparison. In 2016-17 alone, train accidents in India have resulted in 238 causalities. This despite the fact that the number of accidents ‘per million train kilometres’ in India has reduced to 0.1 in 2016-17 from 0.23 in 2006-07. Worse still, according to a study by Niti Aayog, six of every 10 rail accidents in India since 2012 have happened due to human negligence.Every time an accident happens, heads roll and a few railway officials are punished but clearly this does not seem to change the scenario much. Therefore, we may need to remind ourselves of how we landed ourselves into this situation and what is that we can do to improve it.Stocktaking must start from a simple acknowledgement that among other things, the Indian Railways has been treated as a political tool by successive governments. Back in the early 20th century, most of the Indian Railways was nationalised but since its budget formed a significant portion of the total finances of the exchequer, a practice of separate Railway budget was institutionalised from 1924 to ensure that it acts as a commercial undertaking having flexibility in financial matters and higher accountability in administration and operation.But over a period of time what evolved out of this arrangement was a split personality for Indian Railways – an observation also made in the Indian Railways Report 2001 authored under the chairmanship of Rakesh Mohan.The report suggests that on one hand Railways was to act like a self-sufficient commercial organisation while on the other, it has had large social obligations to discharge by virtue of the fact it was a government department.It goes without saying that the performance parameters of commercial projects can be quite different compared to social projects. While the former may entail focus on elements like revenue, profits or return on capital the latter may demand expansion of connectivity or increase in traffic.",1

837,"Castor seed production to be down by 20% in 2018-19: Solvent Extractors AssociationBY ET BUREAU | FEB 25, 2019, 01.12 PM ISTPost a Comment According to the castor crop survey conducted by the Solvent Extractors Association (SEA), the total production in India in 2018-19 is estimated to be down by 20% to 11.26 lakh tonnes in 2018- 19 from 14.16 lakh tonnes, estimated in 2017-18. The area and yield have declined mainly due to inadequate monsoons. The survey noted: ""Total area under castor in India for the year 2018-19 is estimated to be 769570 hectares as per the government’s estimates against 2017-18 estimate of 821600 hectare, which has decreased by 7% compared to the previous year. • Acreage has been reported to have declined in Gujarat, the largest growing state, but it is expected to be almost flat in Rajasthan and Andrhra Pradesh/Telangana. • Average yield for year 2018-19 is estimated slightly down, -12.6%, to 1520 Kg/Ha compared to 1740 Kg/Ha, based on farmer’s response about their yield expectation on present crop conditions."" SEA conducts Castor crop survey for crop estimation in major growing states like Gujarat, Rajasthan, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana every year. This year, SEA commissioned Indian Agribusiness Systems Ltd, known as “Agriwatch” in the industry, to conduct a crop estimation study in above states through field surveys and remote sense data analysis. Total area under castor in Gujarat for the year 2018-19 is taken to be 533800 hectares as per the government’s estimates, against last year’s estimate of 591000 hectares, which has declined by about 10% as compared to the previous year. Agriwatch field survey suggests area under castor to be less by 6% this year as compared to last year’s government estimate and is estimated at 554160 hectares. Using remote sensing technique, the castor acreage for the state is estimated at 549000 hectares, for .. The major reasons for lower acreage this year is less rainfall in key growing belt. ""Estimated average yield for year 2018-19 is expected to be 1751 Kg/ha against last year’s estimate of 2029Kg/ha, a fall by 13.7%. Overall, the farmers are expecting decline in yield this year due to weak monsoon, less growth of plants and less availability of water for irrigation. Total seed production in the state with decrease in area (-10%) and less yield (-13.7%), is estimated down to 9.35 lakh tons in 2018-19 from last year’s estimate of 12.00 lakh tons. The seed arrivals have started in mandis as farmers are selling in small lots to get the higher prevailing prices,"" observed the survey.",0
838,"Central Railway block on day dedicated to punctualityIn a major faux pas, the Central Railway (CR) will operate a six-hour block that will lead to the cancellation of 40 suburban trains and regulation of 20 long-distance trains on Sunday, which was dubbIn a major faux pas, the Central Railway (CR) will operate a six-hour block that will lead to the cancellation of 40 suburban trains and regulation of 20 long-distance trains on Sunday, which was dubbed Satarkata Diwas and, ironically, dedicated to punctuality.Each zonal railway was expected to show 100 per cent punctuality on the occasion, which was created to mark Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s two years in power. The initiative comes under the Hamsafar Saptah, which began on May 26 and will go on until June 1.Mr Modi had issued a diktat across 17 zonal railways, in which instructions have been given that they should observe Sewa Divas on May 28 (Saturday) and Satarkata Diwas on May 29. The Prime Minister has asked railway officers to get down to the grass-roots level on Sewa Divas and travel in trains that they run for the common man.The senior officers were also instructed to talk to passengers themselves and understand their grouses. On the following day — Satarkata Diwas — railway officials were supposed to maintain the best punctuality that is humanly possible by showing a scoreboard of 100 per cent.However, the CR has decided to operate a six-hour block from 12 am on Sunday for laying down girders for the Kasaiwada bridge at Kurla.The CR had demolished the bridge back in December last year, fearing a repeat of the Hancock bridge incident.The Railways could not bring in new rolling stock of a much greater height than old trains, as officials were afraid that the overhead equipment would crash into the bridge, which was located between the Suburban railway stations of Sandhurst Road and Byculla.A railway official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, admitted that the block should have been operated a long time ago.“The fact of the matter is the CR should have operated this block way back. It unnecessarily wasted time on other things and no one gave any thought to the Prime Minister’s anniversary and that he might declare some railway initiative,” said the official.Some officials feel that the block should have been cancelled after the railway week was declared by the railway ministry on May 25, but said that they couldn’t deny that if the block of the bridge was not carried out this weekend, they would have had to wait until the post-monsoon period.“Kurla residents are angry as it is because Ramzan is round the corner and the bridge, which is the only connect the east and west, is nowhere near completion. At the same time, it looks like we are going against the instructions from Delhi and saying we have too much work. But we could afford to not operate the block this weekend had the senior officials done the Kurla work on time,” the official said.",1

Jagan Reddy is Naidu’s bitter rival and a strong contender for the chief minister’s post.Srinivas, the father-in-law of actor and grandson of matinee idol NT Rama Rao Jr NTR, evaded a direct reply from the media on whether he would be joining Jagan’s party. Rama Rao was the founder of the TDP.He is reportedly aspiring for a YSRC ticket from either Guntur Lok Sabha seat or Chilakaluripet assembly segment in Guntur district in the general elections to be held this year. Sources in the TDP said Srinivas is a strong contender for a ticket for Chilakaluripet assembly segment since 2004. But Naidu, it is said, did not entertain his requests to avoid criticism of supporting dynastic politics.Jr NTR is married to Srinivas’ daughter Lakshmi Pranathi, who is the granddaughter of Naidu’s sister. The daughter of the chief minister’s sister is married to Srinivas. And, Naidu is NTR’s younger son-in-law. Srinivas founded a regional TV channel Studio N, which was reportedly taken over by Naidu’s son and IT minister Nara Lokesh.Daggubati Venkateswara Rao, the elder son-in-law of NTR, also met Jagan Reddy on January 27 wishing to join the YSRC and eying a ticket for his NRI son Hithesh.TDP spokesperson Dokka Manikya Varaprasad said Srinivas and Daggubati met Jagan Reddy just for seats.Srinivas’ meeting came right after Lok Sabha member P Ravindranath resigned from the Telugu Desam Party and joined the YSRC in the presence of Jagan Reddy.Jr NTR, who took an active part in the 2009 election campaign for the TDP, was allegedly sidelined in the legacy politics which shifted from the NTR family to Naidu after the chief minister took over the party reins from NTR in 1995.The actor’s father and NTR’s elder son Harikrishna, who was recently killed in a road accident, also remained away from party activities after serving the TDP as a politburo member.",0

Demand for cars, two-wheelers, white goods is sluggish. Consumer non-durables, the growth is over 12%. It is the consumer durable which is sluggish and in negative growth,"" he told PTI in an interview in New Delhi.He said manufacturing capacity is there but sentiments must change for buying durable goods.""That is one part of manufacturing. The other part of manufacturing is the core sectors - steel, iron ore, coal, power, minerals. Manufacturing must grow there also. Output must increase. We must produce more coal, more iron ore, more steel, more aluminium. That will happen as the upturn takes place,"" he said.For example, the minister said, coal production has improved while iron ore which is caught in a number of litigations will hopefully clear with Supreme Court hearing the case.""But many other core industries, the projects are stalled which is why we have now identified the projects which are stalled and we are trying to remove these bottlenecks and things will begin to move.""I think work is at pace. A special cell has been constituted. The Cabinet Secretariat is looking at the projects that can be cleared in next few week.If they require a decision by the Cabinet Committee on Investment (CCI), we will bring it. Once the core sector production goes up, you will find the industrial sector moves up and manufacturing also moves up,"" he said.Chidambaram said the Indian economy was taking time to return to high growth trajectory because of the problems in the western economies.""The upturn (in global economy) that is expected has not taken place. At the same time there is no spiralling down either. I think our economy is getting stabilised. There are some weaknesses ... There are signs that we are moving towards a more stable period. It will take time,"" he said.The minister said the upturn will not happen quickly. ""It is a slow climb. The correct approach is to keep the focus on long term. There are no quick fixes. Take measures for long term and while these measures get implemented, the medium and short term will be addressed,"" he said.The government in recent weeks taken a number of decisions like hiking gas prices, setting up of coal regulator and allowing power producers to import coal to meet shortage.""The last few weeks we have taken a number of measures keeping the long term in mind. They will yield result on the long term, but as they yield result in long term the medium and short term problems will be addressed. There will be many more decisions in July,"" Chidambaram said.He said the Union Cabinet will decide on raising FDI caps in different sectors in the second or third week of this month.""Papers will have to come from the ministry of railway, from the ministry of coal, ministry of mines, from Planning Commission, from the ministry of petroleum, ministry of fertilisers.

847,"Data on mishaps suggest railways’ track record has actually improvedIn the past, when there were two sources to find the number of accident in railways, people often tried to match the two, failing to recognise there were definitional differences between themFor purposes of reporting and analysis, Indian Railways actually classifies accidents under several heads – from A to R(AFP)The National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) brings out an annual publication, Crime in India. In the past, this has also been used as source for figures on railway accidents. For example, in 2015, 26,066 people died because of railway accidents and 2,650 because of railway crossing accidents. Since 2016, NCRB no longer publishes figures on railway accidents. It only has numbers on crimes in railways. Therefore, the sole source for data on railway accidents is now Indian Railways (IR), such as Indian Railways, Year Book.In the past, when there were two sources, people often tried to match the two, failing to recognise there were definitional differences between them. Let me give you a quote from the latest Year Book. “There were 103 consequential train accidents in 2016-17 as compared to 106 accidents during 2015-16.” This does not include Konkan Railway. Notice the qualifier. We think IR reports all accidents; but IR reports only “consequential accidents”, or “serious accidents”. What is a consequential accident? An accident is anything that adversely affects the engine, rolling stock, permanent way and works, fixed installations, communications, passengers or railway servants. We usually think of accidents from a passenger perspective. But there are other angles.For purposes of reporting and analysis, IR actually classifies accidents under several heads — from A to R. For instance, A1 and A3 will be collisions of trains carrying passengers; A2 or A4 collisions of trains not carrying passengers; B represents fire or explosion in trains; C, trains running into road traffic and/or road traffic running into trains at level crossings; D, derailments; E, other train accidents; F, averted collisions; G, breach of block (a block is a segment of the track) rules; H, a train passing a signal at danger; J, equipment failures; K, failure of permanent way; L, failure of electrical equipment; M, failure of signalling and telecommunication; N, unusual incidents; P, casualties; Q, other incidents; and R, miscellaneous.What’s the difference between an unusual incident and other incident? N would be wrecking or sabotage, not usually expected. Q6 would be something like “blockade to train services due to agitation”, not something that can be classified as an unusual incident. You can see why IR’s approach to accidents is different. L2 is “no tension in OHE (overhead equipment) for more than three minutes”. This may not fit with our usual perception of an accident, but the effect can be disastrous.Read moreTo improve performance, Indian Railways must streamline the flow of trafficAcquiring land for bullet train project may get delayed, says Piyush GoyalWe are still left with the question. What is a consequential or serious accident? Certain threshold values are defined for loss to railway property and interruption to communications. A serious accident is one where there is a loss of life or grievous hurt to passengers, or those threshold values are exceeded, or where the Commissioner of Railway Safety (CRS) thinks an inquiry is needed. Data on railway accidents are also available through CRS. However, CRS doesn’t enquire into every railway accident and CRS data about accidents only include those where there has been a CRS inquiry.That Year Book will also tell you IR attended to 982 accidents in 2016-17. How can this possibly match with 103? It doesn’t because 103 refers to those that are “consequential”. There are some exclusion clauses that must be noted too: “ (a) cases of trespassers run over and injured or killed through their own carelessness or of passengers injured or killed through their own carelessness; and (b) cases involving persons being Railways servant or holding valid passes/tickets or otherwise who are killed or grievously injured while travelling outside the rolling stock of a passenger train such as on foot board, roof or buffer but excluding the inside of vestibules between coaches or run over at a level crossing or elsewhere on the railway track by a train; and (c) level crossing accident where no passenger or railway employee is killed or grievously hurt unless the Chief Commissioner of Railway Safety or Commissioner of Railway Safety is of the opinion that the accident requires the holding of an inquiry by the Commissioner of Railway Safety.”The exclusion clause makes it clear that a serious accident only includes instances where there is IR culpability. We might want to change this, but that’s the way it is today.The next time you see a figure on railway accidents, bear these in mind. If you want to check IR’s track record, ask yourself what you are interested in. Fatalities and/or injuries on trains, or fatalities/injuries at level crossings? Collisions, derailments, fires? Whatever the yardstick, you will find (a) cross-country, IR doesn’t do that badly; (b) Over time, the performance has improved. Outside the Year Book, there are 2017-18 numbers and they tell the same story.Bibek Debroy is chairman of Economic Advisory Council to the prime minister and a member of Niti AayogThe views expressed are personal",0
848,"Decision soon on removal of Pakistan cricketers’ photos from Eden Gardens: Sourav GangulyFormer India captain and Bengal cricket boss Sourav Ganguly Saturday said a decision would be taken soon on removal of Pakistan cricketers’ photographs, including that of PM Imran Khan, from the walls of Eden Gardens in the wake of the Pulwama terror attack.Ganguly’s comment came after BJP’s youth wing workers protested in front of the Eden Gardens, seeking removal of photographs of Imran and other Pakistani cricketers from the walls of the stadium.At least 64 activists of BJP youth wing were arrested for staging protest in front of the iconic Eden Gardens, a senior police officer said. They were later released on bail.“We are working on it. There will be a decision soon,” Ganguly told reporters when asked about the removal of photos.The state cricket associations of Vidarbha, Punjab and Rajasthan have already removed pictures of Pakistan cricketers in the aftermath of the terror attack which killed more than 40 CRPF personnel. Pakistan-based terror outfit, Jaish-e-Mohammad, has claims responsibility of the attack.Ganguly had earlier backed a complete boycott of cricketing ties with Pakistan, saying not playing the arch-rivals in the upcoming World Cup won’t have much of an impact on the Indian team’s campaign at the mega event in May-July.Days later, Sachin Tendulkar said he would ‘hate’ to give away two points to Pakistan by not playing in the World Cup and India should rather beat them again in the showpiece event to maintain their unbeaten record over the arch-rivals.“He wants two points against Pakistan, I want the World Cup so...he wants two points I want the World Cup. Whichever way you look at it,” Ganguly said, reacting to Tendulkar’s comments.Eden Gardens has photographs of Imran, Wasim Akram and others kept in non-public areas of the stadium.Former and current cricketers have expressed varied opinions on severing cricketing ties with Pakistan.Many ministers of West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee’s cabinet, including former Bengal captain Lakshmi Ratna Shukla, hit out at BJP for trying to divert nation’s attention from terrorism.“We are more keen on removing terrorism from the world rather than pulling down photographs (of sportspersons). The BJP is trying to divert the attention from the current issue of terror attack. This is clear politics going on in the country,” Shukla said.State Municipal minister and city mayor Firhad Hakim when contacted said people should not confuse politics with sports and culture.Former cricketer and current Bengal coach Arun Lal said that the country was going through an emotional time and countrymen were venting out their feelings in different ways.“I can understand the feelings of my countrymen. I also share the same. This is a very emotional time. We have lost some of our brave brothers and obviously the country is hurt.

I have a good news for you all. The AAP government has covered your medical and social security needs by allocating Rs 50 crore in our budget, which will be presented next week. The allocation will be in effect from April 1,” he said.The CM said this amount was not a one-time fund and that it would be an annual allocation, which is likely to increase year on year.In a second sop to the lawyers, Kejriwal promised that after the Lok Sabha elections, the Delhi government would direct the Delhi Electricity Regulatory Commission (DERC) to permanently change electricity connections of their chambers from commercial to domestic.“This will help you save a lot on your electricity bills. The Delhi government has been giving Rs 230 crore as subsidy to lawyers at present to match the difference. Once DERC makes this change in its tariff order after elections, then this subsidy will not be required,” he said.Kejriwal appealed to the lawyers to vote for AAP in the upcoming general elections so that Delhi could get the full statehood status.“Make us win on all seven seats, we will give full statehood to Delhi. We will raise the matter in Parliament. The powers we enjoy now is not even 10% of what Sheila Dikshit used to enjoy in her 15-year rule in Delhi. Now, I being the CM cannot even appoint my own peon,” he said.",0

However, intelligence sources said that explosives, safety fuses, aluminium electric detonators and cords have been found at some of the shut quarries in south Kashmir. “We don’t want to leave anything to chance. It’s not easy to carry RDX, or any explosive material, in a huge amount in a car in a single day. We want to eliminate the possibility of the role of any local mining quarry in keeping the explosives at a safe place,” said a senior J&K intelligence official. Officials believe that the Jaish terrorist could not have brought the entire cache of explosives at one go and was certainly provided logistic support of these business units. Sleuths have also launched a manhunt for stolen vehicles reported between January first week and February 14 following the uncertainty over the make and model of the car used in the attack. Both NIA and J&K Police sleuths have been divided over the car model, whether it was a Maruti Eeco or Ford Ecosport. Did Pulwama suicide bomber hide explosives in stone quarry? PULWAMA/SRINAGAR: Intelligence sleuths across security establishments in Jammu and Kashmir will now be preparing a list of stone quarries that had got shut in south Kashmir in the last few months amid suspicion that Pulwama suicide bomber Adil Ahmad Dar may have hidden explosives in one of these units. Sources in intelligence agencies said while it was likely that the Jaish-e-Mohammad terrorist had used imported military grade RDX from Pakistan in the IED used in the February 14 Pulwama attack, the sophisticated gadgetry could have been provided at one of the local quarries. There are about 30-odd quarries in south Kashmir, including in Pulwama, Anantnag and Shopian. These quarries often use illegally procured explosives and detonators.

853,"Don't mind losing my job, says TrivediRailway minister Dinesh Trivedi had promised a “revolutionary” rail budget to some of his cabinet colleagues on Tuesday. But his party chief Mamata Banerjee smelled a “rebellion” in Trivedi’s budget instead after he hiked passenger fare—allegedly keeping her in the dark—and left him with two options: roll back the hike or quit.For the first time in the history of parliament, the railway minister’s own party opposed the budget and left him in the lurch. Many in the party believe, Trivedi will have to make a quick choice as Mamata Banerjee ruled out any compromise on her “pro-people” stand.Trivedi, however, tried to put a brave face: “I have done my work as the railway minister. Now I leave the rest to the God.”Although fares have been raised across all sections, a roll back in the suburban (2 paise per km), second class (3 paise per km) and sleeper class (5 paise per km) may mollify the Trinamool chief, sources close to her told HT. Banerjee reportedly sees these fare tweaks as anti-poor and anti-aam aadmi.If Trivedi refuses to roll-back and puts in papers before the rail budget is passed, that would be another unprecedented event in parliament’s history. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh will then have to steer the budget till its passage. The option of asking Trivedi to continue till the passing of the budget also remains with the PM. However, Mamata Banerjee may not agree to such arrangement. Poll: Is it time for Cong to part ways with Mamata?A furious Trinamool chief Mamata Banerjee, who had repeatedly warned Trivedi against tinkering with passenger fares in the run-up to the budget, claimed that the railway minister did not consult the party before raising the fares. There was no direct communication between the railway minister and his political boss“As railway minister, he has the right to take own budget decisions. But the fare hike is totally against the policies of Mamata Banerjee and the party,” Trinamool’s parliamentary party chief Sudip Bandopadhyay told HT after a livid Banerjee called him from Nandigram area of West Bengal and vented her ire.Banerjee’s temper reportedly further soared at Trivedi’s praises for the finance ministry. Railway ministry got a loan of Rs 3000 crore from the government to tide over its immediate financial crunch.“Trivedi may shower lofty praises on the finance ministry but that ministry has offered no help to make West Bengal a financially stable state.”Trying to bring the Indian railway back on track, Dinesh Trivedi gets derailed in Trinamool’s political tracks.",1
854,"Drunk drivers are a Delhi policeman’s nightmareDelhi Traffic Police officers say that “hostility” from drunk drivers is one of many reasons why just over 100 motorists were prosecuted for the offence everyday on an average last year in the national capital.Traffic police personnel in the national capital say they are frequently threatened, sometimes assaulted or even mowed down by motorists when they attempt to prosecute drunk driving.(HT?File )“Blow into the alcometer,” the traffic policeman’s order was loud and clear. The SUV driver pretended to blow, but actually held his breath towards the end. The policeman knew just how to deal with the situation. “Loudly count till 10,” was the next command.In the next few seconds, the policeman had scientific evidence of the motorist having 105 mg of alcohol per 100 ml of blood, more than thrice the permissible limit. But what followed next was just what the policeman at the picket near Connaught Place fears every evening.The policeman had to fight off threats of action and repeated phone calls asking him to let go of the driver.This was a relatively much easier situation for the policeman to handle.Traffic police personnel in the national capital say they are frequently threatened, sometimes assaulted or even mowed down by motorists when they attempt to prosecute drunk driving.On better days, a motorist snatches away their alcometer as was seen at Barakhamba Road last November.Traffic Police officers say that “hostility” from drunk drivers is one of many reasons why just over 100 motorists were prosecuted for the offence everyday on an average last year in the national capital.The 37,188 prosecutions for drunk driving in 2018 were 11% more than the 33,343 previous year, but road safety experts say these figures are just the “tip of an iceberg”.“The drunk driving checking is not as frequent and widespread given how rampant the menace is in Delhi. A driver’s judgement is badly impaired after drinking and he is just lucky to reach his destination without harming anyone,” says Piyush Tewari, founder of NGO SafeLife Foundation.As per a study in America, an increase of Blood Alcohol Concentration by 0.02% doubles the relative risk of a vehicle crash among 16-20 year old males. That risk increases to 52 times when the BAC is between 0.08% and 0.10%.In India, motorists are not allowed to drive if the alcohol content is found to be over 30 milligrams per 100 millilitres of blood.According to a late last year’s survey of 5,000 Delhi motorists who drink, 3,605 (72.1%) of them admitted to drinking after driving. The survey, which was conducted by NGO ‘Community Against Drunken Driving’, found that 1,768 of those drivers said they regularly took to the wheel after drinking while 1,837 said they drove under the influence of alcohol only occasionally.More importantly, 78.6% of the respondents said they were not checked for drunk driving in the last six months of the survey.“The enforcement agencies do not take the issue as seriously as it should be. They view it as a seasonal traffic offence which happens during festivals like Holi, Diwali and new years,” says Prince Singhal, the NGO’s founder.According to the 2017 data put out by the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways, drunk driving caused 124 mishaps in Delhi and left 24 people dead and 126 injured. Across the country, drunk driving was the reason for 14,071 mishaps which killed 4,776 people and injured 11,776.But Tewari dismisses the data saying that most drunk drivers get away after causing an accident, leaving investigators clueless about the condition of the driver.“Delhi is a hub of hit and run cases. Many motorists abandon their vehicles after a mishap. When they are caught after a day or two, there is no evidence of drunk driving,” says Tewari.The act of fleeing after a mishap or fighting with the police after getting caught for drunk driving arises from the relatively tough penalties for drunken driving, says Alok Kumar, joint commissioner of police (Delhi Traffic Police).“Drunk driving is one of five traffic violations which lead to seizure of driving license for three months. No motorist wants to part with their license. I haven’t heard of one drunk driver who accepted the penalties without fighting with the traffic police on duty,” says Kumar.What also scares the motorists is the possible arrest and imprisonment up to six months, impounding of their vehicles and penalty of Rs 2,000. “The repeat offenders are the ones who are usually the most aggressive because they can be jailed up to three years and fined Rs 3,000,” says JCP Kumar.Out on the roads, the traffic police officers say they not only face a host of excuses and tricks by offenders, but also violent behaviour that risks the lives of the general public.“Each of these drunk drivers knows some influential person or the other. It becomes very uncomfortable for us to fend them off. In case the driver doesn’t know someone who can bail him out, he will try to take a U-turn or speed away, without bothering about its consequences,” says a traffic police inspector in west Delhi’s Rajouri Garden.JCP Kumar says that after drinking most drivers have a “false sense of bravado” and believe they can drive better.The CADD study found that one in every four of its respondents believed they drive better after drinking.",0
855,"Dubai-bound plane hijacker had issues with wife, wanted to speak to Bangladesh PM:?OfficialsBangladeshi commandoes shot a passenger on Sunday who had tried to enter the cockpit of a Biman Bangladesh Airlines flight after waving a gun and threatening to blow up the plane, airline and aviation authority officials said.The passenger, who had said he had a personal issue with his wife and told the pilot he wanted to speak to Bangladesh’s Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, died later from the injuries suffered after the commandos stormed the plane at Chittagong’s Shah Amanat International Airport, officials said.“We tried to arrest him or get him to surrender but he refused and then we shot him,” said Major General S M Motiur Rahman of the Bangladesh Army.The man’s threat to blow up the plane, which was on its way to Dubai from Dhaka via Chittagong, led its pilots to make an emergency landing.Before the commandos moved in, all 142 passengers and most of the crew had been let off the aircraft unharmed. One crew member had been held hostage, the officials said.Air Vice Marshal Nayeem Hasan, chairman of the Civil Aviation Authority of Bangladesh, told reporters at a news conference that as well as holding what appeared to be a pistol the passenger said he had explosives bound to his body.With the plane close to Chittagong after leaving Dhaka, the passenger stood up from his seat and tried to go to the cockpit, according to aviation officials. When a member of the crew blocked his way, he showed his pistol.He then said he had explosives and if they didn’t open the door of the cockpit he would blow up the plane, officials said. Other members of the crew alerted the pilots to the problem and they asked air traffic control for an emergency landing.It was not immediately clear if he had explosives, though the pistol was real, according to a senior aviation official. It also wasn’t immediately clear if the pistol was loaded or how it got through security at the airport in Dhaka.The security questions are a matter of concern and would be the subject of an investigation, said the aviation official.The man appeared to be in his 20s, and was probably Bangladeshi as he was speaking Bangla, but his identity was not yet clear, Hasan said.",0
856,"Ease in procuring licences makes Delhi’s roads dangerousOut of 10 major cities, Delhi stood sixth in the list of drivers who had procured a licence without taking a test.There are 1,200 unauthorised motor training institutes in Delhi, a plea in Delhi High Court said.(HT?File )Overtaking from the wrong side, inching bumper-to-bumper with the car in front and wrongly navigating the city’s roundabouts — Delhi’s drivers have a lot to learn when it comes to safe driving practices.But if these basic rules were largely ignored, then how did these drivers get their licences?The Delhi government has of late started a major crackdown against the growing corruption in regional transport offices by launching dedicated helplines to report cases of corruption. The ease in procuring drivers’ licences in the city, however, was an issue that was ignored for years.This resulted in the growth of untrained drivers who know little about the rules to be followed once they are behind the wheels.Till very recently, touts who offered to even appear in tests on your behalf for a meagre payment of Rs 3,000-Rs 4,000, were a regular sight at transport offices.“We have a no-tolerance policy for touts who take bribes and offer to issue licences. We conduct regular inspections and have also put up boards for the awareness of people to report such activities,” said Delhi’s transport minister Kailash Gahlot.Startling figuresData released by the Union ministry of road transport and highways (MoRTH) showed that in 2017, around 80% of road accidents in India was caused by valid licence holders.A 2018 survey by road safety NGO SaveLife Foundation also corroborated this dangerous trend. Data showed that 59% driving licence holders in India never took a test and thus did not completely understand road safety rules.Delhi did not fare too well in this test either.Out of 10 major cities, Delhi stood sixth in the list of drivers who had procured a licence without taking a test. At least 54% of Delhiites, compared to the national average of 59%, claimed to have not taken the competency test while applying for their licences.Unauthorised driving schoolsA plea filed in Delhi High Court last year had sought action against around 1,200 unauthorised motor training institutes that had mushroomed in the national capital.The classes imparted by these private schools are usually spread over 15 days and comprise six to seven hours of training and charge anywhere between Rs 1,800 and Rs 2,500.A student, who may have never sat in the driver’s seat, is directly ushered onto the busy and dangerous roads of the city on the first day of the class.“There is nothing to worry. We have full control of the vehicle,” says Hari Lal, a 37-year-old trainer at a driving school in west Delhi.By mentioning control, Lal was referring to an additional set of brakes and clutch fitted into the passenger’s side of the car.“There is no chance of an accident. I’ll apply brakes the moment a student loses control of the steering,” he adds.Many students say they feel confident while being trained, but are clueless while taking their own vehicles on the roads later.“I was caught in a massive jam and just didn’t know how to negotiate my way out. I had to seek the help of another motorist to get out of the situation,” said Deepa Vijay, who was trained by an unauthorised school.Nitin Kumar, an IT professional, said he found the training imparted to be inadequate. “I had to go through the training a second time because I wasn’t taught how to reverse, how to do parallel parking, how to shift lanes or the right use of mirrors,” said Kumar.Kumar said he was never taught how to drive a car on a flyover in busy traffic. “There were many important instructions I never received. I took to YouTube videos to learn important things myself,” said Kumar.But Girish Sharma, president of All India Motor Driving School Association, believes that those trained by even the unauthorised schools are better than those who learn by themselves or are trained by family or friends. He said that barely 10% of all motorists seek training from driving schools.“The trainers are mostly those who quit authorised driving schools or are awaiting licence. They teach their students about road signs, how to handle practical situations, to ensure there is no one in front of or behind the car when they switch start a car,” said Sharma, adding that even the unauthorised school trainers did more good than bad.But Sharma said it was necessary that only authorised motor driving training schools were allowed to operate so that only properly trained people were allowed to teach others.Many learners said that these trainers also doubled up as agents who promised to help them get driving licences easily. “I have to attend the driving test, but I have been assured that I will pass, no matter my performance,” said a learner, who didn’t want to identify himself.Tougher tests and uniform licensingFrom July this year, all states will have to issue uniform licences with security features, which will allow police and security agency to access driver information on the spot. Road safety experts, however, said that the need of the hour is to fix the process of licence procurement.“The process of driver tests needs to be made more transparent. Learners’ tests need to ensure that the applicant knows the basic rules of driving before they hit the road,” said Madhumita Deshpandey, co-founder of Road Safety Records, a Delhi-based research organisation, which focuses on road infrastructure and safety.Recently, Delhi introduced a one-of-a-kind automated track test centre in Sarai Kale Khan. The centre makes getting a drivers’ licence difficult by stimulating tougher driving conditions.Experts also said that certifying driving trainers under government rules will also help ensure the training is up to the mark. In several cities in the US, retired police officials take up the task of training new drivers to ensure that the theory of driving is also mastered.",0
857,"Eight killed in 12-vehicle pile-up on Rohtak highwaySeveral accidents were reported from highways in the Gangetic plains which was covered by dense fog on Monday morning, reducing the visibility to bare minimum.Eight persons, including seven women, were killed in a vehicle pile-up due to dense fog on the Rohtak-Rewari highway in Haryana on Monday, police said. At least 10 others were injured in the accident that took place in Jhajjar district in which over 12 vehicles, including a school bus, were involved, they said.Several accidents were reported from highways in the Gangetic plains which was covered by dense fog on Monday morning, reducing the visibility to bare minimum. Former state health minister Satyanarayan Lathar was killed in Jind after an unidentified vehicle hit him when he was walking home from his petrol pump late on Sunday night, police said.According to police, all the victims in the Jhajjar accident were from Kirdodh village and were going to Najafgarh in Delhi in a jeep to condole the death of a relative there. The jeep collided with a pick-up vehicle and was hit by a speeding truck from behind, police said, adding that the injured were taken to Pt BD Sharma Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences in Rohtak.“Eight persons were killed in the accident that took place in the early morning. At least 12 vehicles were involved in the pile-up,” said Seema Devi, station house officer, Jhajjar police station.The pile-up occurred after the two vehicles collided on Badli Flyover on National Highway-71 and around 10 more piled up behind them due to poor visibility, leading to more injuries. There was a school bus involved in the accident, which led to a two-kilometre traffic jam, but none of the passengers was injured, police said.Seven women and one man who were sitting in the back of the jeep were killed, while two more sitting in the same vehicle were critically injured. The deceased have been identified as Satpal Kumar (48), his wife Kanta Devi (40), Santosh Devi (52), Prem Lata (50), Laxmi Devi (63), Ram Kali (35), Sheela Devi (61) and Khajani Devi (54). They were cremated in the village Monday afternoon amid a pall of gloom.“A woman in Satpal’s relation had died in Najafgarh, for which the entire family was going there to pay our condolence. The visibility was very poor due to fog. Only 20 minutes in journey, we were hit by a truck from behind and all this happened,” said Dheeraj, son of Santosh.The Haryana government has announced a compensation of Rs 2 lakh to the kin of the deceased. “Compensation of Rs 2 lakh will be given to the kin of the deceased, Rs 1 lakh to those severely injured and Rs 50,000 to those with minor injuries,” Haryana minister OP Dhankar said.The northern part of the country, including Haryana and Punjab, has been reeling under the cold wave for the past one week. “Cold weather combined with the availability of moisture will result in foggy conditions over Northwest India. This dense fog is likely to reduce visibility over Punjab, Haryana, North Rajasthan, Delhi and Uttar Pradesh, resulting in difficulty for commuters in the morning and noon hours,” stated Skymet, a private weather forecasting agency.Dense to very dense fog was observed at isolated places over Punjab and West Rajasthan and moderate fog at isolated places over Haryana, Chandigarh, Delhi and West Uttar Pradesh in the morning hours.

These were unserviceable anti-aircraft ammunition.On average, unserviceable ammunition has caused 65-70 accidents annually since 2013-2014.In May this year, an official of the Ordinance Factory died during a routine check of L-70 ammunition at a forward ammunition depot near Pathankot in Punjab. “The accident happened when a validation exercise for L-70 rounds was being carried. The round went off accidentally killing an OF official,” a senior army officer who didn’t want to be named said.Apart from ammunition for the L-70 guns, ammunition for tanks and Armoured Personnel Carriers are also a cause of concern for the Indian ArmyAs many as 19 personnel, including two officers, died when faulty anti-tank mines exploded at the Central Ammunition Depot in Phulgaon in May 2016. Surprisingly, while an internal inquiry pinned the blame on the Ordnance Factory and some of its officials, no was held accountable. Two officials found to be responsible by the inquiry have even superannuated, according to a second Ministry of Defence official who did not want to be named .An audit of faulty ammunition being done by the Department of Defence Production , which supervises the Ordnance Factory, was stopped following the death, this official added. “The Indian army has been promised an improved version of L-70 ammunition fuse next year by the Ordnance Factory Boards. The audit has restarted in July”.The issue is technology, a retired army officer said.“Ordnance factories have not been up to date with the technology upgrades; recently, Indian made ammunition for the newly procured M-777 Light Howitzers malfunctioned causing an accident. Ordinance factories must acquire new technology and maintain better hygiene,” Brigadier S Chatterjee (retd) said.Defence Ministry spokesperson, Colonel Aman Anand, did not respond to queries. Unserviceable ammunition isn’t the only concern for the Indian Army, Ordnance Factories have also consistently failed to produce adequate quantity of ammunition.“The present state of preparedness has created voids due to the limited production capacity of the Ordinance Factory and consistent slippage in production targets,” the Indian Army told a Parliamentary oversight committee on defence last year.Informing the Ministry of Defence and Parliamentary oversight committee, the Indian Army wrote, “Out of 22 items indented on Ordinance Factory Boards, as part of the Ammunition road map, 14 items were not supplied at all.”The Indian Army also asked for the accountability to be fixed on the Ordnance Factory Boards for “poor quality,” slippages” and delays in supply of ammunition.",0

The ministry has asked for a report for implementation of transfer policy for rotation of officials working in sensitive regions to enable vigilance directorate to put the information for the perusal of higher officials.“It is reiterated that all concerned may examine the feasibility of transferring the officials working on sensitive posts at the earliest and ensure that no incumbent dealing with sensitive work continues on any sensitive post beyond the stipulated period as advised to zonal railways from time to time,” said the directive issued by railways.This comes after the Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) issued a directive in August this year reiterating that all government departments should ensure rotational policy on sensitive posts. It further said that analysis of frauds in public sector banks and other organisations show that one of the reasons for such frauds was non-implementation of the rotation policy.             The CVC had asked that all departments strictly follow rotational transfer policy and heads of all departments should ensure implementation of the policy.In 2015, Member of Parliament N F Patole had complained to the railway’s ministry about some officials occupying sensitive posts for over 15-20 years and creating hurdles in the transparent functioning of various departments.

864,"From white jalebis to INS Vikrant, Naik’s memoir has it allIn a political career spanning over five decades, governor Ram Naik faced several interesting incidents that form a part of his memoir ‘Charaivati-Charaivati’ (Marching ahead, marching ahead) written in Marathi and now translated into Hindi, English, Urdu and Gujarati, which will be released by President Pranab Mukherjee at the Rashtrapati Bhawan in New Delhi on November 9.In Lucknow, his memoir would be released on November 11 in the presence of Union home minister Rajnath Singh and chief minister Akhilesh Yadav.In his labour of love, Naik has included interesting things he had to deal with right from rechristening Bombay to ‘Mumbai,’ use of edible colours in sweetmeats, preservation of INS Vikrant and even finding the Constitution of India written in Hindi on gold leaves!“As an MP, I was required to handle a plethora of diverse matters. One of them was prohibiting sweetmeat makers from using edible colours in their products. Union health minister AR Antulay was among my acquaintances. The makers argued that it would be more reasonable to order them to use only permitted food colours of specified quality. However, if the ban was implemented in toto, there would only be white sweets. Imagine eating white jalebis and pedhas,” said Naik.From sweetmeats to INS Vikrant, Naik quickly changes track and recalls how the INS Vikrant was declared a national monument but it had to be disposed off as a scrap due to the failure of Maharashtra and Central government in preserving the warship that helped India win the 1971 war against Pakistan.Recalling another interesting anecdote, the governor said how his initiative led to Bombay being rechristened as ‘Mumbai.’ And a simple query about the Hindi manuscript of the Constitution of India in the Parliament Library literally led him to the ‘golden book.’“While I was reading in the Parliament Library, I came across the original English edition of the Constitution. Curious, I asked to see the original Hindi edition of the Constitution. Quite an amusing tale unfolded from this simple query. The original Hindi edition was written down by Vasant Vaidya, a Maharashtra calligraphist. Gold plated pages were imported from Germany and a special kind of ink, used for writing this edition, was brought from a reputed firm in China. The writing instrument was a special pen, crafted by the famous Watkins Company, made in Washington State, USA. It had taken Vaidya a full year to complete the writing of the Constitution on the gold plated pages. The Hindi edition is decorated with sketches of Lord Shri Ram, Shri Krishna, Gautam Buddha, Rani of Jhansi and several personalities from our cultural and historic past.”Changing tracks once again, Naik while referring to his tenure as chairman of the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) says, “One of the major assignments of the PAC is to investigate in case of any dubious transaction made by various government agencies after they are recorded by the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG). I created a record by submitting eight reports of PAC in one year. The most sensational of these reports was about the misuse of official aircraft belonging to railway ministry by the then railway minister CK Jaffer Sharief.

One has to be sensitive towards them,” Rana tweeted after he was allotted an upper berth in Suhaildev Express on Sunday night.He posted a series of tweets to express his anguish.“Hum AIIMS me admit hone ke liye jaa rahe hain, 3 passengers me se 2 senior citizens hain, uske bawjood hume upper berth allot ki gayi...Kya senior citizens ko yahi facility milni chahiye?’ Rana tweeted tagging the railway ministry and railway minister Piyush Goel.In his second tweet, he also posted his PNR number and berth details.Rana said thankfully a co-passenger offered his own berth to make their journey comfortable.He was travelling with two other passengers – Munawwar Jafri, 68, and Adil Rasheed, 52 – on PNR number 2726069792 and boarded the train from Lucknow in AC-II.“Railways has to be more sensitive towards senior citizens. All three of us were given upper berth making a sheer mockery of our age,” said Rana.“We were clueless as to how to climb up the berth as our knees are not much supportive,” he said, adding it was insensitive on the part of railways which compelled them to plead for berths from co-passengers.“It’s not our age and stature to beg for berth. What do titles like ‘Saraswati Putra’ mean for us when railways don’t even have the courtesy to respect our age,” he said.Read moreSummer heat can be dangerous for the elderly. 6 tips to protect them65-year-old in Mumbai cheated of Rs17.67 lakh in insurance fraudChief public relations officer, Northern Railways (NR), Nitin Chowdhary said: “Berth allocation system is programmed in a manner to give priority to senior citizens and female passengers in allocation of lower berths. However, once the lower berths get reserved, there is no choice but to allocate upper berths.”“As per the allocation system in AC-II, there is a provision to allocate only three lower berths on first come, first serve basis. It can be a woman above 45 years, a pregnant woman or any senior citizen,” he said.First Published: Apr 24, 2018 12:50 IST",1
866,"Govt mulls pvt role in rly, scrapping of fare subsidyScrapping the railway board, merging the rail budget with the main budget and withdrawing the passenger fare subsidy are among the radical reform proposals the government is considering, official sources said.Railways minister DV Sadananda Gowda is also contemplating a role for private stakeholders in policy-making and lateral entry for IAS officers into the top rail hierarchy to “de-centralise and corporatize” the functioning of the public transporter, which carries roughly 23 million passengers daily.“The railways served the nation well in the initial decades after Independence, but its administrative and institutional structure and functioning seems archaic and unscientific in the present context and needs overhaul. These tasks are huge and difficult and will need to be attempted progressively,” Rail Restructuring Committee chairman Bibek Debroy told HT.The committee was set up recently by the Indian Railways to take forward Gowda’s budget announcements on restructuring the rail ministry and railway board.All these reform proposals have been mentioned in the reports of several expert committees.A top government priority is to replace the “outdated and flexible” accounting practices with a professional “corporate accounting” system that can provide scientific data on the profits and losses of rail operations, the sources said.“The railways must eventually work towards… charging passenger fares commensurate with expenses incurred in providing for the cost of travel. But the progressive hike in fares will also have to be matched with better passenger amenities,” Debroy said.Currently, passenger fares are hugely subsidized, resulting in an annual loss of Rs. 25,000 crore in this segment. A proposal to merge the railways’ nine different cadre and provide for a single, unified cadre — to be called the Indian Railway Service — is also part of the surgical operation plan.",1
867,"Green patches, seats at regular intervals increase walkability quotientWhile on the one hand, Delhi has some of the most beautiful and pedestrian-friendly roads such as Sardar Patel Marg or Kasturba Gandhi Marg, it also has stretches such as the one between ISBT Kashmere Gate and Majnu Ka Tilla, where pedestrians are forced to walk on the main roads and risk their lives due to the lack of walkable footpath.Experts say greenery should be maintained round the year to make footpaths walkable. (Amal KS/HT Photo )Mention the word ‘walkability’ and it immediately conjures up an image of a foreign city such as Paris and London — with people walking on wide footpaths adorned with lush green trees and hedges, seats at regular intervals and colourful shops and eateries along the way. But a careful glance at our city will tell you that Delhi doesn’t have to look beyond its territory to understand what the term entails.While on the one hand, Delhi has some of the most beautiful and pedestrian-friendly roads such as Sardar Patel Marg or Kasturba Gandhi Marg with their canopy of trees, broad sideways with well-laid green patches, on the other hand, it also has stretches such as the one between ISBT Kashmere Gate and Majnu Ka Tilla, where pedestrians are forced to walk on the main roads and risk their lives due to the lack of walkable footpath.Elaborating on the issue, architect and urban planner, AGK Menon, said, “A walkable road needs proper planning and integration of greenery, aesthetics, safety and public utility right from the planning stages. But unfortunately, most roads in the city sans the ones in Lutyens’ Delhi lack this. Sometimes, you see a bus stop right in the middle of the footpath, sometimes, there are no trees to provide pedestrians with shade, and at times, the footpaths are dug up.”But then, one might ask, what does greenery have to do with walkability.The connectionA study conducted by the Delhi Traffic Police in 2016 revealed that road accidents in the New Delhi area — which has massive green coverage and continuous walking facilities for pedestrians — was at least 40 per cent lower than the rest of the city. It also showed that pedestrian deaths in accidents in this area were almost 85 per cent lower.The connection between green coverage and road accidents was first established by the government of Mexico City in 2015, which assessed some of the busiest and the most accident-prone stretches, for over a decade and increased the green coverage there. After the project was completed, it was seen that not only were accidents on the stretch controlled but also that incidents of road rage among drivers had gone down.In a statement released to the local media, the Mexico City government had said the green cover “had acted as a stress buster for drivers” who were otherwise more aggressive on roads. This, they said, became a boon for pedestrians, who had also found the newly developed area more accessible.“Greenery along sideways and footpaths not just provides shade and increases your convenience while walking, it also soothes your senses and keeps you happy and calm. The moment you start walking with your senses feeling the surrounding, it slows you down and acts as a recreation for you. The hedges along edges of footpaths keep you from getting down on the roads, thereby bringing down the chances of accidents,” said KT Ravindran, urban designer and former chairman of the Delhi Urban Art Commission.Curbing pollution woesThere are umpteen studies that have revealed how greenery along roads and footpaths could help bring down pollution. A latest study by researchers from the University of Surrey has shown that hedges can bring down vehicular pollution by more than 60 per cent.In 2009, the Indian Road Congress (IRC) had laid down certain guidelines and objectives that need to be followed while selecting plants.“The objectives while selecting a plant species — as laid down in the IRC — are to reduce air and dust pollution, arrest soil erosion, mitigate extreme climatic conditions, reduce noise pollution, among others. But these are hardly followed in plantation drives,” RNS Tyagi, former horticulture director of the Central Public Works Department, said.Experts said a mix-and-match of big canopy trees and hedges are ideal for footpaths. It, in fact, make roads more walkable.“Just like we need woods and greenery, we also need open spaces. Both are important for us. And for this, we need a proper plan. We can’t just go on planting trees just for the sake of greenery,” author and conservationist, Pradip Krishen, said.Moving aheadSo how exactly do we go ahead? Experts said that to integrate greenery with roads so that they could become more walkable should be the primary objective among planners right from the initial stages.“A major criterion while making a city or its roads walkable is to see that the walkbale streets do not end abruptly. They should have some continuity and end in open spaces such as a park,” said Ravindran.Planners also said the more interactive a footpath -- with lots of greenery instead of a mundane looking road with ‘dead’ walls — the more it will increase walkability.“If the road has spaces with greenery, shops and eateries, which a pedestrian can see, walkabilty increases. A dull road with walls blocking your sight reduces the walkability quotient,” Ravindran maintained.But just planting trees and hedges won’t help. Experts said that in an attempt to make roads and footpaths more walkable, greenery should be maintained round the year. Unless maintained, these green stretches could become shady dark places and become unsafe.“Whenever we think of widening a road or coming up with an infrastructure project, the first thing we see is that trees are chopped off. Sometimes, when footpaths are retrofitted, the bases of trees are all concretised despite a National Green Tribunal (NGT) ruling against such practices. Residents should be involved so that greeneries could be maintained more efficiently,” said Kanchi Kohli, legal researcher at Centre for Policy Research.",0

My eight-year-old son played with snow throughout the way.”Groom along with his family treks to Makku Math in Rudraprayag district for his wedding ceremony after roads were blocked due to heavy snow. (HT Photo)A wedding ceremony with only 25 people is rare in Uttarakhand, but one such wedding took place on Friday at Makku Math in Rudraprayag after the groom along with his relatives walked for over 6km in heavy snow to attend the ceremony.Around 80 people had left for from Triyuginarayan village in the district to attend Rajnish Kurmachali’s wedding ceremony at Makku Math, but were stuck in traffic after vehicular roads were closed due to snow. The family then decided to send only those people who were needed for the rituals such as the groom’s maternal uncle, sisters and some elderly people. The dolled up family undertook a 6km long unique marriage procession, with children playing in the snow to reach their destination.“We had seen a wedding procession like this in 2002 and now this was the next one. People will talk about this procession and the wedding for years as in both the weddings the groom was an army jawan,” said Ashish Gairola, the groom’s brother.Speaking on whether the journey was difficult for the family, Gairola said, “If you see the pictures then you would question whether they were even feeling cold, forget difficulty. My eight-year-old son played with snow throughout the way.”Since the last seven days, the village has not received power supply, making it difficult for them to carry out daily chores. The groom’s brother added that people have been charging their phone batteries through their cars due to power outage.Bijay Lal, head of Triyuginarayan village said, “Even I had to go to the wedding but were all stuck due to the snow. But those who went enjoyed the whole journey and the wedding took place without any problem.”Mangesh Ghildilyal, district magistrate of Rudraprayag said, ""We received information about this wedding where people had to walk all the way. It is good that they walked, as due to continuous snowfall, there are high chances of accident as cars can skid."" He added that machines have been deployed to clear the snow in the village but due to incessant snowfall the roads are still blocked.",0

In an exclusive interview with HT, Nishant threw light on what makes the show stand out from others, why it’s tough to work in the television industry and more.Actor Nishant Malkani is 31 and portrays the role of a father to three grown up men on TV show Guddan Tumse Na Ho Payega. With no grey hair in sight, the actor is seen as the husband of 20-year-old Guddan who owns the title of India’s youngest mother-in-law. In an exclusive interview with HT, Nishant threw light on what makes the show stand out from others, why it’s tough to work in the television industry and more. Excerpts:Tell us more about the show Guddan Tumse Na Ho Payega.The story is about a man and a woman who meet accidently and go on to tie the knot. Both of them are poles apart. While the woman is around 20 years old, the man is in his mid-thirties. The woman is very innocent and even though she has good intentions, she ends up screwing everything. On the other hand, this man is very mature but is still in love with his first wife. They get married accidently due to unexpected circumstances. This man is the adopted son of the family and ends up being a father to three sons and a father-in-law to their wives. So when he marries Guddan, she ends up becoming their mother-in-law as well (as told in the show’s tagline – Guddan India ki youngest saas hain).You play a father to three grown up men in the show. Were you not apprehensive about playing such a role?Initially, I was apprehensive but the makers convinced me about the theme of the show. They were not going to give me grey hair or make me look older. They told me how a lot of twists and turns were going to come in the story and that I was not their real father. What’s interesting about this character was that while he is an angry young man in front of everyone, he was a very chilled out and loud person in the company of his former wife. This is a man who will show his anger even when he is in a romantic mood.Taking a time leap is a common trend on Indian TV shows. If the makers take a time leap of 20 years, will you be ready to play a 50-60 year old on screen?I will be apprehensive but it completely depends on why and how they will justify the time leap. If I find it interesting, I will do it and if I won’t, I will step back.How do you bond with your team?We have a very good team, all of us are very good friends. We have a house party at one of the people’s houses on an off day. We bond like college friends when not working.You have also done a few films.My last film was Bezubaan Ishq in 2016. I do have plans to do films but I am committed for 25 days in a month for this show. As long as I am shooting for this one, I won’t be able to take out time for other things. But after that, I will pick up whatever interesting comes my way. It can be anything – a film, a web series or another TV show. Right now, all three platforms are doing so well that as an actor, there is a lot of scope for anyone to grow.What is the major difference between the television industry and Bollywood?In films, you have a bound script, you know the entire graph of the character and his journey from end to finish. In a television show, everything changes every week. The TRPs decide what works and what doesn’t work and what we are going to do with the story. If the character is not working, we change the character, if not the actor. As an actor, one has to be very flexible to adapt all the time. If the show goes on for a year, you have to come on the screen everyday but yet do something different to keep the audience hooked. I believe shooting a film is much easier than a TV show.",0

After a slump in tourism due to the killing of Hizbul Mujahideen commander Burhan Wani in July 2016, it took frequent spells of snow in January this year to bring large number of foreign tourists to Kashmir amid militancy.The good start to the tourist season of 2019 comes after the industry took a downturn in 2018, a year which witnessed military offensive. Over 8.5 lakh tourists including 50,000 foreigners visited the Valley in 2018 as compared to 11 lakh in 2017. Tourism director Nisar Wani said ,“We received 25,095 tourists across Kashmir in January this year, including 2,480 foreigners,” Wani said.The arrival of foreign tourists has seen a surge. The figure was 1,405 in 2016, 1,170 in 2017, 2,369 in 2018 and 2,480 in 2019. Domestic tourists in January 2018 were 49,000. Wani said domestic arrival was affected as national highway closed due to snowfall for 12 days in January. “The highway closure also increased the price of air tickets exponentially. However, we continue to see more tourists. On February 3, 2019, we saw the highest daily arrival of 1,400,” he added.A chance discovery for someTourists enjoy skiing and heli-skiing on the slopes of Gulmarg.Rob, 32, an Australian did not know that there was a place Gulmarg in India. He said he came to know about the ski resort by accident on internet as it was snowing in the area. “I was stunned when I reached here on January 22,” he said. Rob has decided to stay here for a month and do what he likes the most – snowboarding.“I first visited Manali and then stumbled upon this place. I am happy that I did. The experience here has been beyond my imagination. This is the best place for skiing and snowboarding,” said Rob.Rob, an Australian, loves snowboarding and said he discovered about Gulmarg by accident on Internet.

The last day for the ministry and the board to file its responses is May 18.Kumar’s lawyer Pankaj Sinha, himself visually challenged, submitted before a bench headed by Chief Justice Dipak Misra and Justice Sanjiv Khanna that “the differentiation was uncalled for.”The Railways justified the denial of e-ticketing facility, saying the electronic reservation slip could be misused by general public by making false claims of disability.But the court prima-facie found the argument untenable.

874,"Henkel goes vegan to revive beauty businessGerman consumer goods company Henkel announced new hair care formulations and brands on Thursday, seeking to tap into consumer demand for more natural ingredients as it tries to revive sluggish growth in its beauty business.Henkel will relaunch its European shampoo brand Schauma with a “vegan” formula, roll out to more markets its Nature Box line of hair and body care products made from cold-pressed oils and launch a new “free-from” hair dye line called OnlyLove.It will also launch a premium vegan brand for professional hair salons called Authentic Beauty Concept and expand its Pro Nature range of cleaning products to include detergents.The move comes as shoppers become more wary of processed chemical ingredients and seek out natural alternatives.Chief Executive Hans van Bylen told a news conference the products certified as vegan will initially address a niche market, but he sees strong potential and said the move will eventually help the company adjust all of its formulations.“The increasing shift towards a green lifestyle and the strong increase in the number of vegans has driven the growing demand for plant-derived ingredients in beauty products,” said Magda Starula, analyst at market data firm Euromonitor.The world’s biggest cosmetics manufacturer L’Oreal bought vegan beauty product firm Logocos Naturkosmetik last year and it has launched its own vegan range, Botanea, sourced from plants found in India.Unilever has also launched a fast-growing hair and body brand called Love Beauty and Planet, that is certified as vegan and cruelty-free.Henkel said the Schauma brand’s vegan formula will not contain silicones or parabens, while the Authentic Beauty Concept line will include “pure” ingredients.Henkel, the maker of Schwarzkopf shampoo and Persil detergent, made the announcement after warning in January that earnings would fall this year as it steps up investment in brands and digital technology to try to revive growth.The company has underperformed rivals like Procter & Gamble Co (P&G) and Unilever in recent years, with underlying sales in its beauty care business falling 0.7 percent in 2018 and the laundry unit growing just 1.9 percent.Henkel’s beauty care unit saw organic sales growth recover to 1 percent in the fourth quarter, but it still lagged behind adhesives and laundry, which grew 2.1 percent and 2.8 percent respectively in the period.Van Bylen said Henkel plans a global relaunch of its Persil brand, with new “four-chamber” detergent pods key to reviving growth in North America, where it is battling P&G for market share.",0
875,"High court admits plea against RPF personnelThe Bombay high court on Thursday admitted a public interest litigation (PIL) which sought a probe by Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) in an alleged scam run by Railway Police Force (RPF) of booking petty offenders in railway offences and then releasing them on fake bail bonds.Observing that prima facie offence was made out against RPF personnel, a division bench of justice BH Marlapalle and justice UD Salvi admitted the petition.The court has also issued notices to the Ministry of Railway and Ministry of Home, Government of India, asking them to file affidavit explaining their stand towards investigation against RPF officials.Public prosecutor Pandurang Pol submitted an affidavit filed by commissioner of police, Railways, which said that their “investigation revealed that offence was committed by RPF personnel on duty Thane Kurla in 2008-09 by using fake bail bonds and false documents and misappropriating the money collected from commuters after charging them with relevant sections under the Railways Act”.Pol also told the court that a special investigation team was formed to probe the alleged scam.The petition was filed by social activist Samir Zaveri alleging a scam relating to cash bonds issued by the RPF personnel at Kurla railway station in 2008-09.It claimed that certain RPF personnel were releasing persons booked for trespassing on fake cash bail bonds. They then asked the commuters to pay Rs 500 bail bonds each in fake courts staged by them. Track trespassing is an offence under section 147 of the Indian Railway Act.

876,"How an illiterate rickshaw-puller became a mascot for educationAhmed Ali from Assam’s Karimganj district, while pulling his cycle rickshaw one day in the late 1970s, felt miserable at the realization that like him his soon-to-be-born child too will remain illiterate.Ahmed Ali from Assam’s Karimganj district, while pulling his cycle rickshaw one day in the late 1970s, felt miserable at the realization that like him his soon-to-be-born child too will remain illiterate and may have to pull a rickshaw for a living.Hailing from Madhurband village, when Ali, now 82, moved to Karimganj town, about 300 km from Guwahati, he often saw children attending school and getting educated, and sometimes even ferried them to and from their homes to their schools in his rickshaw.The thought of his child not getting proper education hit him so hard that he decided he should do something about it so that poor children of the coming generation, including his own, do not suffer in privation like him.Since then, Ali has gone on to build nine schools and, because of his singular effort, he even found a mention in Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ‘Mann Ki Baat’ radio programme.“I feel it was Allah’s wish and blessings from locals that I could achieve whatever I wanted,” says a humble Ali.“I could not attend school due to poverty. People of my village were poor and it pained me to see the children there were not able to attend schools due to the same reason. I don’t want to see dropouts from poor families any more,” Ali told IANS during a function in Delhi where he was invited as a guest.For establishing the first school, he sold a portion of his land and donated another portion on which the building now stands. The funds for the schools were also arranged by him from his savings, daily earnings and some from charity.“There were some people in the area who supported the cause and helped in whatever way they could,” he said.To ensure there was no fund crisis for the school, he used to pull his rickshaw in the morning and cut wood at night. He sold that wood and used the money to build the school and later to run it.“There was not even a single school in the area. I had this very strong feeling that when my children will be born, they too will not have any school. After the birth of my first child (a boy), the feeling became more strong,” he said.The school, he added, was even more important for girls as “boys get a chance to go out and get an education, but girls do not”.With a firm resolve that he should do something about it, Ali met an education officer, whom he used to ferry in his rickshaw, and with his help, he established a middle school in his village in 1978.“Soon after it was established, I realised that first, we needed a primary school. Until children were educated at the primary level, who will get enrolled in middle school? In 1980, three-LP (Lower Primary) schools were opened,” he said.In all, Ali has opened three lower primary (class I-V) schools, five middle (class VI-VIII) schools and one high school in Madhurband and nearby villages.“Education is an important thing, and everyone should get a chance to get educated. It is a sin for anybody to not be educated,” he said.“Although I may be illiterate, I get respect from people. They now come to seek my blessings. I feel joy when I see that boys and girls from the village have been attending school. This joy inspired me and I never felt tired,” said Ali.“I get satisfaction when girls come and tell me how helpful these schools were for them. Every year, the overall number of girls in schools is higher than boys.”The high school, started in 1990, has 228 students in the current year. Every year, hundreds of students appear for the Class X exams, but they don’t have a place to study further.“I could only manage to make arrangements for students till Class X. They don’t have a place to study Class XI and XII. I need both the government’s approval and funds for setting up the higher-secondary school,” Ali said, in the hope that he will soon accomplish that as well.“There is no nearby college. The nearest college is also 15 km away. I also want to build a college for students, but that will come at a later stage. First we need a junior college (for students passing Class X),” he added.Ali came to limelight in March last year when Prime Minister Modi spoke about him in his monthly “Mann Ki Baat” address.Ali feels proud that the Prime Minister acknowledged his work and he desires to meet Modi.Asked what he will tell Modi, Ali said he wanted all that the schools should be government-recognised so that funds were never an issue. “I will also ask him for a junior college and a college, if possible.”",0
877,"How Kim Jong un went from pariah to guest of honorKim Jong Un’s arrival in Vietnam by train this week for a second meeting with US President Donald Trump may be most remarkable for how normal it’s becoming.Since opening talks with South Korea last year, the once-reclusive North Korean leader has turned into one of the most sought-after guests in Asia. At each stop -- from Beijing to Singapore and now Hanoi -- Kim, 35, is being escorted down red carpets by officials eager to build early ties with the head of one of the world’s last untapped emerging markets.The swing from international pariah to guest of honor is a testament to Kim’s success in wresting power from military chieftains and eliminating rivals since his father died in 2011. It also illustrates his long-held desire to restore an economy drained by decades of famine, state planning and military expansion under his father and grandfather.“If you want to really understand the Kim Jong Un of the present, you have to travel back to his early years,” said Kim Young-hui, who defected from North Korea in 2002 and is now a senior economist at the Korea Development Bank’s Inter-Korean Economic Cooperation Research Unit.He wondered why his father, Kim Jong Il, hadn’t traveled overseas much “and why North Korea was so poor,” she said, citing a book by a Japanese chef who worked for the late dictator. “Kim Jong Un was thinking that when he became the leader, he would run the country a lot better than his reclusive father.”Over the past seven years, the Swiss-educated Kim has steered North Korea from his father’s “military first” policy focused on building a nuclear arsenal to one that emphasizes the economy. After successfully testing an intercontinental ballistic missile in 2017, he declared the weapons program “complete,” initiated talks with Trump and announced a new strategy for boosting the economy.The move ended Trump’s threats of war and paved the way for a historic first meeting with the US president in June. It also opened a new world of potential investors from Seoul to Singapore -- provided Kim can get Trump to relax international sanctions against his weapons program.Trump played down expectations that he might quickly ease pressure on North Korea, telling US governors gathered at the White House on Sunday: “I’m not pushing for speed, but we’re not removing the sanctions.”In recent months, Kim has railed against the sanctions, which do everything from ban travel by officials to curb its energy imports. North Korea ranks as one of the world’s poorest countries and the sanctions are believed to have helped cause the country’s deepest recession in two decades in 2017, according to South Korean estimates.“When they come to negotiations, it means they are having a tough time internally due to sanctions and Kim feels nervous,” said Thae Yong-ho, who was North Korea’s deputy ambassador to the UK before defecting in 2016 and becoming a critic of the regime.Kim left Pyongyang on Saturday afternoon on a train that will take him through China down to Vietnam. He traveled abroad five times last year -- more than any North Korean leader in at least two decades -- often visiting industrial sites. Kim reportedly plans to do the same in Vietnam ahead of the planned summit, giving him a close-up view of a fellow socialist state that has prospered after easing hostility with the US.North Korean officials have been spotted near Samsung Electronics Co.’s smartphone plants in Vietnam, the Yonhap News Agency reported last week, suggesting Kim may tour South Korean factories. While South Korea is Vietnam’s second-largest trading partner, a North Korean leader hasn’t visited Vietnam since Kim’s grandfather, Kim Il Sung, in 1964.Trump himself has repeatedly cited Kim’s development goals while arguing why North Korea would trade its nuclear arsenal away.“Chairman Kim realizes, perhaps better than anyone else, that without nuclear weapons, his country could fast become one of the great economic powers anywhere in the World,” Trump tweeted on Sunday. “Because of its location and people (and him), it has more potential for rapid growth than any other nation!”Kim hasn’t secured his control over North Korea by showing weakness. His reign has been marked by ruthless purges and executions, including the killing of his uncle and one-time deputy, Jang Song Thaek, as well as the murder of his older half-brother, Kim Jong Nam.That consolidation of power has given him the space to introduce economic and government reforms once seen as nearly impossible in the insular, one-party state. And it’s allowed him to shake hands with Trump, the leader of a country that North Korean propaganda has spent generations blaming for all of its problems.Even now, the purges appear to be continuing. Kim exiled, imprisoned or executed 50 to 70 members of the country’s political elite last year, including opponents of engagement with the US, according to a report published last week by the North Korea Strategy Center, a Seoul-based research institution founded by a former defector.“Kim Jong Un has been very skillful in rewarding the friendly, co-opting the neutral and punishing the hostile,” said Moon Chung-in, special adviser on foreign policy to South Korean President Moon Jae-in, said in an interview earlier this month. “His longevity is institutionally guaranteed. But at the same time he’s good at consolidating power.”Kim now needs to show the elite back in Pyongyang that his engagement efforts can bring economic opportunity without sacrificing the country’s nuclear deterrent -- its “treasured sword.” The regime has a long history of coming to the bargaining table dangling the prospect of cooperation, only to renege on deals after extracting economic concessions.Chun Yungwoo, former chief South Korean envoy to international nuclear negotiations with North Korea, said Kim’s successful consolidation of power requires him to consider what kind of country he wants to rule over for the next 40 to 50 years.“He wants to have a more prosperous country -- he wants economic development,” Chun said. “Without giving up nuclear weapons, all he can do is maintain a subsistence-level economy.”",0
878,"How railways put men at 11 level crossings a day Indian railways did away with at least 11 of its thousands of unmanned level crossings every day during the past 10 months to eliminate these death traps. The last such crossing on broad-gauge lines was converted into a gated one in Allahabad on Thursday, the same day railway minister Piyush Goyal confirmed in his budget speech that these unmanned crossings were a thing of the past. According to railway ministry officials, an accident on April 16, 2018 involving a school van at such a crossing on Kaptanganj-Thawe section in UP that claimed 13 lives was the turning point for putting the focus on quickly doing away with these crossings. “The ministry had told the Parliament these crossings would be a thing of past by March 2020. But work on a war footing was undertaken to complete the task earlier after the accident,” said an official. The number of accidents at unmanned level crossings has been at an all-time low at only three during this fiscal as compared to 65 in 2009-10. Sources said in most of the cases either mechanised or manual system of operating gates have been operationalised to stop vehicles from crossing the tracks when trains go past these spots. They added at some crossing, they have route relay interlocking system where the rail traffic flow is highe Officials said the railways had zeroed down on four models to eliminate the crossings including merger with another level crossing by constructing diversion road, construction of subway or rail under bridge and manning. The last option was found to be most cost effective and less time taking. Building rail under and over bridges often require land acquisition and other permissions.",1
879,"Huawei says Mate X’s India launch depends on 5G availability, no plans for 4G?variantPowered by the company’s Kirin 980 processor, the Huawei Mate X comes with a 6.6-inch dual display panel and offers a FullView display.Dashing hopes of Indian consumers willing to acquire the just-released foldable phone from Huawei any time soon, the company says it is not planning to bring a 4G version of the Mate X shortly and that its availability will depend on the 5G network in the country.Although India is targeting 2020 for 5G roll-out, the country is yet to allocate 5G spectrum to operators even for 5G trial of use cases.Expensive at 2,299 euros (about Rs 1,85,000), the foldable Mate X is a 5G phone and as the US has been raising security concerns over use of Huawei 5G equipment, the European market could be the first to see the release of the phone.Huawei showcased the foldable phone at Mobile World Congress (MWC), Barcelona, on Sunday, but did not allow the visiting journalists to touch the device.“We expect to start shipping the device form the middle of this year through the carrier channel. Making the device available in the open market may take some time,” Kevin Ho, President of the Handset Business, Huawei Consumer Business Group, told IANS here.Replying to a question about producing foldable phone for the 4G network, he said that although the company was not focusing on bringing a 4G to suit markets like India, it could consider such a proposal at a later stage.Powered by the company’s Kirin 980 processor, the Huawei Mate X comes with a 6.6-inch dual display panel and offers a FullView display.It houses massive 4,500 mAH dual battery and several industry-first features, including a new superfast charging capability that can reach 85 per cent battery in just 30 minutes.The phone features a flexible OLED panel and a falcon wing mechanical hinge.“Creating the foldable phone’s hinge is the most challenging part for our engineers,” Ho said. “We had to design the hinge to avoid layers like formation that one gets when one folds a book or a notebook. This was a big challenge and they had to use a sophisticated technology,” he added.While Ho asserted that the phone was ready for mass production, he acknowledged that the company was still doing several tests and was also in talks with app developers so that apps can be optimised for a foldable device.The 8GB + 512 GB phone, which can be easily unfolded at the click of a button, now has only one colour, Interstellar Blue, and comes with a full protection case. Huawei said it might introduce new colours for the device at a later stage.When unfolded, the 6.6-inch dual display panel transforms into an 8-inch tablet only 5.4mm thick.While unveiling the device on Sunday at a packed hall here, Huawei Consumer Business Group CEO Richard Yu claimed that the phone offers best selfie camera. But the company did not reveal the camera specifications.“The phone will provide users more privacy and security protection,” he said.“Today, many carriers are using NSA (non-standalone) architecture, working together with 4G. But the future of 5G is SA (standalone) architecture.“Mate X is the only phone now with the capability to work in both the architecture. So this phone is not only for today, but also for future 5G,” Yu noted.Ho parried questions on security concerns raised by countries like the US which accuse Huawei of passing on data to the Chinese government.“We don’t want to talk about it today. We want to focus on technology and our new products today,” he said.",0

No casualty was reported.The crash happened barely 15 minutes after it took off from Gorakhpur air base along with two other Jaguars for routine exercise.Panic-stricked locals rushed to the site of the burning wreckage in large numbers, Kushinagar district magistrate Anil Kumar said.An eyewitness said they saw the aircraft explode in flames in the sky before hitting the ground with a bang while the pilot landed in a sandy area close to the river bed.“Two other such planes continued to hover in sky when the aircraft crashed. The strong winds intensified the flames of the burning plane and soon it was reduced to ashes,” said another eyewitness.On being informed by locals, police and administration officials, including DM Kumar and senior superintendent of police (SSP) Rajeev Mishra, rushed to the accident site with rescue teams and fire tenders, while an air force chopper airlifted the injured pilot to Gorakhpur airbase where he was admitted for treatment of minor injuries on his back.While the cause of the crash is not known, a court of inquiry has been ordered by Gorakhpur air force officials.Speaking on phone, wing commander Prayagraj air force station, Arvind Sinha, said: “An inquiry has been ordered to look in to the reason of the mishap.”The district magistrate said “the pilot showed courage and presence of mind by diverting the plane away from populated area towards the Chhoti Gandak river but it crashed midway in a field after catching fire. He saved his life by jumping off the plane when it was just about 150 metres from the crash site. He is fine and undergoing treatment at Gorakhpur air force hospital”.",0

882,"Illegal shrines derail centre’s multi-modal terminal project in VaranasiThe National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government’s plan to set up a so-called multi-modal terminal which provides rail, road and waterways connectivity in Varanasi , Uttar Pradesh has run into trouble because of places of worship that have been illegally constructed on the land meant for the project.“Land has been an issue in this project. There are certain sensitivities; there are three mosques and four temples on the railway land on which we want to build the terminal,” a senior official at the ministry of road transport said requesting anonymity. This person added that the ministry doesn’t want to push things on this front because demolishing places of worship could become a contentious issue ahead of the next year’s parliamentary polls.The proposed terminal at Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s constituency is part of the Jal Marg Vikas Project (JMVP, a Rs 5,369 crore World Bank aided project on the Ganga, aimed at augmenting the navigational capacity of the Varanasi to Haldia stretch of the river, to enable commercial navigation of at least 1500-2000 ton vessels).The land in question belongs to the Railways which leased it out to National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) for construction of a bus and a railway terminal.“This is railways’ land and has been given to the NHAI on an ‘as is where is’ basis and they were to further develop that land. The issue is that on some of the land there are mosques and temples. They are unable to find a way to remove them. So i don’t think that project will be able to go forward,” a senior official at ministry of railway said on condition for anonymity.The government had awarded the contract to AFCONS Infrastructure for the construction of phase I of the Multi-Modal Terminal at Varanasi for Rs 170 crore.“ Railways land is usually very old, this one must be around 150 years old hence we don’t know when or how these structures were built they assume that they have been built in the last 20 years. The land is around 100 acres big. We had handed over the rights of the land to NHAI about two months ago,” the railways official said.The Detailed Project Report (DPR) of the construction of the project was prepared by NHAI. It involved building a multi-modal terminal including a railway station and a bus terminal. The land is situated at Kashi station in Varanasi. “There is no easy solution to such sensitive issues. The basic issue is that before construction has to happen it is important to remove these places of worship. NHAI has asked the civil administration to look into it but they also have their own compulsion since this happens to be a sensitive religious issue,” the railway ministry official added.The project has been caught up in land related issues since its inception. Another piece of land near the proposed water terminal couldn’t be acquired initially.“We had some issues which were finally sorted out. There was a group of ‘Hindu Mahants’ who had ownership of the land and they argued that they would not vacate this till the government gave them another plot in the same area, which also was disputed. Officials and state had to get involved to resolve it,” a senior official at the ministry of shipping said.Union minister for road transport, highways and shipping Nitin Gadkari laid the foundation stone for the terminal at Varanasi in August, 2016. The ministry is now considering changing its plans. “There are many land related issues in this project. There was also a small patch of land which was allotted and leased to some trust and now the trust claims to own the land. There are issues with some religious structures. So we are looking at whether it is feasible to overcome this or adjust the entire layout of the multi-modal hub, “ the road ministry official said.Under JMVP, three multi-modal terminals are being constructed at Varanasi, Sahibganj and Haldia. The total financial progress for the project at the end of 2017-18 was ~678.85 crore or 13.05%. JMVP is scheduled to be completed by December, 2022.According to officials at the ministry of shipping and the IWAI, the government is keen to get the water terminal inaugurated by PM in November. According to IWAI, nearly 85% of the work has been completed for the water terminal. The agency added that all issues related to land have been addressed. “The project construction is going on schedule without any hindrances,” IWAI said.",1

884,"In Gorakhpur rally, PM Modi set the tone for Lok Sabha poll battle in PurvanchalPrime Minister Narendra Modi has set the pitch for a fierce poll battle in Purvanchal region (east UP) with the announcement of the launch of Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN) as well as Rs 10,000-crore development projects for the region on Sunday.Aware of the importance of 31 Lok Sabha seats of east UP that will be crucial in regaining power at the Centre, Modi said the NDA government had launched several development and welfare schemes to give thrust to development in the region.“The projects will pave way for development of Purvanchal that remained neglected under the Congress, Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) and the Samajwadi Party (SP) governments,” he said.The prestige of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) will be at stake as its top leaders, including PM Narendra Modi, Kalraj Mishra, Manoj Sinha, Varun Gandhi, Mahendra Nath Pandey and UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath come from this region.In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the BJP had swept this region by grabbing all the seats except Azamgarh that went into the SP’s kitty. The Congress won two while the BSP failed to open its account.As the BJP plans to bag maximum seats from the region, various development and welfare schemes have been announced during public meetings in PM’s Lok Sabha constituency Varanasi, located on the southern tip of Purvanchal, and Gorakhpur that is located in the north.With the SP-BSP combine and the Congress also shifting their focus on Purvanchal, the BJP is going all out to win maximum support from the region.The SP-BSP alliance has shared equal number of seats in Purvanchal to give a tough fight to BJP.Once a strong fort of alliance partners, the BJP made inroads into their vote base in the 2014 Lok Sabha election.SP leader Shivram Yadav said, “Riding on Dalit-Backwards-Muslim formula, the alliance hopes to check the BJP.”The Congress has appointed Priyanka Gandhi Vadra as its general secretary for east UP. The region had played a major role in the formation of UPA government in 2004 and 2009 Lok Sabha elections.In 2014, Congress was wiped out in Purvanchal which was its stronghold since Independence.Congress has also appointed three secretaries – Zubair Khan, Kumar Ashish and Bajirao Khade – to assist Priyanka in the battle of ballot. The party plans to win over upper castes, Dalits and Muslims that were its traditional vote base.That the BJP is concerned over the SP-BSP alliance as well as Congress’s Purvanchal plan can be gauged from the fact that during their address both the PM as well as the CM highlighted the government’s development schemes and attacked the opposition parties.Modi said the BJP government strengthened health facilities in the region, restarted fertiliser factory, electrified rail routes, started manufacturing of railway engine in Varanasi and Gorakhpur to pave way for prosperity in the area.Political analyst AK Mishra said, “To retain the BJP’s hold on Purvanchal region, Modi launched PM-KISAN Scheme in Gorakhpur. Purvanchal region is the agriculture hub of the state and the support of farmers will play a decisive role in elections. The SP-BSP alliance is working on caste equations to win the election while Congress is depending on the magic of Priyanka Gandhi. Besides YogiModi charisma, BJP is playing Purvanchal development card to win the election.”",0
885,"In the next 3-4 years, all trains will run fast and on time’Manish Anand , said that his ministry would soon move the Union Cabinet for approval of “government-to-government” partnerships with foreign countries, a step beyond the concept of foreign direct investment.We saw big-ticket FDI investment in the railway workshop projects at Madhepura and Mahraura in Bihar to the tune of Rs 40,000 crore. What would be the next big FDI investment in the railways We have seen massive interest from a number of countries in the modernisation of our railway stations. South Korea has already submitted its model of redevelopment of the New Delhi railway station. South Korea is ready with a proposal to invest as much as Rs 8,000 crore in the modernisation of the New Delhi railway station. The model is with us, which will be a complete gamechanger as far as a railway station is seen. France is keen to redevelop the Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus in Mumbai. The French are also working for the re-development of Ludhiana station. In the coming times, we will see major FDI inflow into the railway sector.You have been to Germany, France, Japan and many other countries. The railways appear to have become India’s engagement with foreign countries. What can we expect from these countries in the railways We are soon going to the Union Cabinet for approval to enter into “government-to-government” (G-G) investment (agreements). We are ready to sign agreements with as many as 14 countries. They are ready to partner with Indian Railways to make their governments partners in the progress of the railways. Among the 14 countries are Japan, China, Germany, Czechoslovakia, South Korea, France and the United Arab Emirates. G-G investment is better than FDI for the railways because here we do not have to worry about the involvement of private players. The money will come from the government of the partner country. In the coming years, we are going to witness massive G-G investment in the railways. Japan alone is going to invest close to $25 billion in Indian Railways, besides the bullet train project.After commissioning the semi-high-speed rail between New Delhi and Agra, what progress can we expect on speeding up the railways We are going to offer one semi-high-speed route each to the 14 countries with which we are soon going to operationalise the G-G investment model. These countries will build the infrastructure and Indian Railways will integrate them into the existing system. Thus, we can have a large number of semi-high-speed rail networks getting commissioned at the same time; this can change the very face of the railways and the country in the next four to five years.We already are holding trials of the Spanish semi-high-speed Talgo trains. It’s a matter of a few weeks in which we will know the full details of the claims being made by Talgo. Once we get the details, we will take the next course of action.The Bibek Debroy Committee on the restructuring of the Railway Board was constituted soon after the Narendra Modi government came to power. Many more committees have in the past submitted reports. What is being done about their reports So far we have already implemented almost 90 per cent of the recommendations of the Bibek Debroy Committee. We have constituted two cross-functional directorates for non-tariff revenue and mobility, which will directly report to the chairman, Railway Board. We have already delegated powers to the general managers and divisional railway managers. Soon we will sign a memorandum of understanding with the zonal railways in which we will ensure their functional autonomy. Thus, much of the desired outcomes of the various committees have been implemented so far, and much more will be done. Very soon we are also going to establish the rail tariff authority. We are currently examining the legislative and non-legislative components of the proposed authority.In the beginning of the coming to power of the Modi government, we heard much talk about the lateral entry of professionals in government departments. Is the idea still alive We are soon going to induct 100 interns from outside the railways who would become part of the organisation. We are keen to take outside professionals, and the cross-functional directorates would look to benefit from their talent pool.With a soft loan from Japan in place for the bullet train project between Ahmedabad and Mumbai, the popular perception persists that such investment should have come in for existing railway infrastructure. There is a place for a five-star hotel in an economy and similarly a bullet train project too is important for the country. In our economy we have five-star hotels where we do not expect the common man to go. We are not going to invest anything in the bullet train project. The money is coming from Japan. But we will gain from the induction of technology, the safety standards, the capacity to execute big-ticket projects, besides the huge spin-off effect on the economy by spending such a huge sum of money in the country.When are we going to see the fruits of the investment being made in capacity augmentation by the railways, which has been the priority of your two projects In the last financial year we commissioned 2,828 km of new lines, broad gauge conversion and doubling. In the next two years we will add almost 7,000 km of such lines. We are going to invest close to Rs 45,000 crore in the next two years for such projects. By 2019, we hope to commission the twin dedicated freight corridors between Dadri and JNPT, Mumbai and Ludhiana-Kolkata. With their commissioning, much of the tracks will be available for running of trains and will also allow us to time-table the goods trains. In the next three to four years trains will not only run on time, but fast and tickets would also be available on demand",1

889,"Indian Railways And Facilities Provided To The PublicIn the entire world, Indian railways has gained the position of being the largest public system of passengers transport. About 7500 trains for passengers are run by Indian railways carrying 12 million people on an average every day. The first train was run in 1853 from Mumbai’s Victoria Terminals to Thane. A British engineer Robert Maitland Brereton was responsible for the expansion of railways from the year 1857 onwards. Indian Railways is world’s seventh largest utility employer with over 1,376 million employees. As for rolling stock Indian Railways holds over 2,45,267 freights wagons, 66,392 passenger coaches and 10,499 locomotives and runs 12,617 passenger trains and 7421 freight trains daily. Indian Railways earn about 70 per cent of its revenues from freight traffic so majority of its profits come from freight and this makes up for losses on passengers fares low it cross-subsidises the loss making passenger traffic with the profit making freight traffic. However its share in freight traffic is much lower than road traffic. This should be looked into and rational approach for fixing fares for goods trains and passenger trains. Railways has two UNESCO world heritage sites namely the Chatrapari Shivaji Terminus and the mountain railways of India. But, this huge organisation is running in losses of Rs. 30, 000 crores in the passenger segment for the year ending March 2014. As in the practise of railway ministry, new railway line projects are announced during the railway budget each year, without securing additional funding for them. In the last 12 years 99 new line projects worth Rs. 60,000 crores were announced out of which only one project is complete till date while four projects that are as old as 30 years, but are still not complete. This practise of announcing new railway line projects needs a serious approach and should not be announced without proper sanction of budget is there. The passenger facilities like waiting rooms and retiring rooms, needs a serious and practical approach. The passenger associations and railway employees must be consulted on regular basis. Often there are no proper electricity connections for charging mobile phones and they are over crowded. Most of the major railway stations have these waiting rooms, but one cannot be sure of their presence in all stations across India. Retiring rooms are there in larger and important railway stations. Retiring rooms can be basic rooms or dormitory or suits. But these retiring or waiting rooms lack recommended amenities. The railway ministry must pay attention to them rather than to announce new railway line, which may not come without provision of funding.",1

A release from ISMA said: ""As on 15th February, 2019, 507 sugarNSE 14.71 % mills in the country have produced 219.30 lakh tonnes of sugar, as compared to 203.55 lakh tonnes produced by 494 mills on the corresponding date last year. Higher production this year is mainly because Maharashtra and Karnataka sugar mills started their crushing earlier this year. Overall, the country is expected to produce less sugar this season as compared to last season."" According to ISMA, in Maharashtra, sugar production till 15th February 2019 was 82.98 lakh tonnes, compared with 74.74 lakh tonnes produced last year same period. In the current 2018-19 SS, 6 mills have closed their crushing operations in the State while 187 sugar mills are operating, as against 183 mills operated last year on the corresponding date. Due to early start of mills in Maharashtra, the mills therein are expected to close earlier than last year, especially when the sugar production from Maharashtra will be less than last year. In U.P. 117 sugar mills are in operation and they have produced 63.93 lakh tonnes of sugar till 15th February 2019, compared with 64.54 lakh tonnes produced by 119 mills on the corresponding date of last year. The sugar recovery achieved this season is about 0.77% more than what was achieved so far during the last season, but the yield per hectare is lower than last year, because of which the total production in U.P. will be less than last year.In case of Karnataka, till 15th February, 2019, mills have produced 38.74 lakh tonnes of sugar, 10 mills have closed their operations in the State while 57 mills are in operation. During the corresponding period last year, 52 mills had produced 30.73 lakh tonnes sugar. In case of Tamil Nadu, 33 sugar mills are in operation and have produced 3.50 lakh tonnes of sugar, as compared to 2.90 lakh tonnes produced by 28 sugar mills in 2017-18 SS on the corresponding date. Gujarat has produced 7.78 lakh tonnes of sugar till 15th February 2019 with 16 sugar mills in operation. Last year, 17 sugar mills were in operation and they had produced 7.25 lakh tonnes of sugar on the same date. In Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, 24 sugar mills have produced 4.50 lakh tonnes as on 15th February 2019, as compared to 4.60 lakh tonnes produced by 23 sugar mills on the corresponding date last season. In Bihar, Uttarakhand, Punjab, Haryana and Madhya Pradesh & Chhattisgarh, sugar production till 15th February 2019 has been in the order of 4.90 lakh tonnes,2.15 lakh tonnes, 3.75 lakh tonnes, 3.60 lakh tonnes and 3.20 lakh tonnes, respectively.

At least 200 have been injured.Sources said the probe team was also looking into allegations that the two loco pilots — Janak Sharma and Pramesh Purohit — were drunk at the time of the accident. Sharma, Purohit and train guard Ajay Srivastava appeared before the inquiry panel headed by rail safety (eastern railways) commissioner PK Acharya on Tuesday to record their statements. “Blood samples of the pilots were taken and sent for medical examination. The report hasn’t come yet,” said Acharya.The panel summoned 41 railway employees of different departments in Jhansi railway division for their written statement. Some people, mostly passengers, also came to record their statements.The panel will record statements of people and railway personnel for two days but the period can be extended. The inquiry report will be submitted within a month to the Railways ministry.Railway men mostly stuck to the version that there was no problem with the train. Gate man Ravindra Paswan, who was at gate no 197 at the time of the mishap, said in his deposition before the panel that the train was moving at normal speed and there was no issue with it.However, Ishwar Dass, another railway employee, said when the train passed his point at 3.01am, it left the overhead wires dangling, indicating that it was running at high speed.

893,"International Conference On Decarbonization Of Indian Railways- Mission Electrification Begins TodayMinistry of Railways through Institution of Railways Electrical Engineer (IREE) in partnership with ASSOCHAM India is organising the International Conference on Decarbonization of Indian Railways- Mission Electrification today. Member Traction, Railway Board Ashwani Kumar Kapoor briefed about this conference and gave following information:-An International Conference on “Decarbonization of Indian Railways – Mission Electrification” is being organized in New Delhi on 3rd Nov.’16.The Conference aims at bringing various stakeholders on a common platform for exchange of ideas and to deliberate on implementable technological solutions and financing options to significantly increase pace of electrification and achieve the target for setting up of renewable energy installations with total capacity of 1000MW by 2020.The Conference will also project Indian Railways as an attractive investment destination considering its plans for huge investment in next 5 years towards modernization of its electrified network and use of renewable energy.The Conference shall cover aspects relating to policy, technological modernization, mechanization, innovations and financing models for railway electrification and de-carbonization. National Transport Development Policy Committee (NTDPC), in its report, has identified electrification of railway tracks as a means to reduce fuel consumption. The report has recommended for taking up electrification on priority through systematically tackling the bottlenecks in progress of electrification projects. It has also suggested that electrification should be viewed as a means of making rail transport independent of imported fossil energy, while also provide a choice in sourcing energy. Moreover, electric traction allows regeneration of power while braking/coasting and feeding the network, thereby reducing overall consumption of energy and carbon emissions. In this regard, following action has been planned for improving efficiency and bringing in cost economies in freight and passenger operations. Reducing the Carbon Foot prints through use of sustainable and green sources of energy is also a key focus area.In line with this vision, following action plan has been planned: Electrification of Railway TracksCurrently 28,000 rkm of tracks are electrified (42% of the total network) carrying around two-thirds of total freight traffic and 50% of total passenger traffic. As against 800 kms of average electrification in the earlier years, 1600 rkm of railway tracks were electrified in 2015-16. To fast track the pace of electrification, Ministry of Railway would be involving PSUs like IRCON, RITES and PGCIL. Increase in the pace of electrification will reduce its fuel bill by Rs. 10,000 cr. annually as against the business as usual approach. Harnessing Renewable Energy on IR to reduce energy cost and carbon footprints Indian Railways targets to harness 1 GW solar and 500 MW wind power as announced in Rail Budget 2015-’16, 500 MW of solar units on roof tops through Central Finance Assistance (CFA) from MNRE and balance 500 MW on land.",1

895,"Is it curtains for Congress' Bansal?One could hear a pin drop at former railway minister and Congress candidate Pawan Bansal's residence at Sector 28 on Friday afternoon, as it became clear that the Chandigarh MP for the last three times in a row will lose the seat. As it later transpired, he lost by 69,642 votes, the highest-ever for the city, polling 1,21, 720 votes.The day started as usual for him as he rose even before sunrise, at around 5:30am. A quick shower and prayer followed by a cup of tea was what it took for him to be ready to accept the people's verdict, and as the day wore on, he looked increasingly downcast. The handful of supporters that had gathered before counting began also dwindled away as the trends that showed him trailing trickled in.So, as Bansal with wife Madhu visited the counting centre at around 9:30am and was back in half an hour, the writing was on the wall and the deserted Congress office in Sector 35 said it all.It is clear that the Railgate, the infighting within the party, the anti-incumbency against the UPA, the nation-wide Modi wave and the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) factors combined led to the defeat of the four-time parliamentarian.With the Congress suffering a humiliating defeat across the country and Bansal losing, in what was his bastion, is it curtains on the political career of the veteran political leader?Bansal, who had held important positions in the UPA-1 and UPA-11 including the parliamentary affairs ministry and the railway ministry, will be without any work now as HT brings you the reasons for the loss.Less than expected votes from coloniesAs more than half of the 6.13 lakh voters were from colonies and villages and the turnout here had always been high, Bansal had expected a sizeable number of votes. He probably failed to hold ground here against the Modi wave. The BJP's focus on highlighting the Railgate, where his nephew was caught by the CBI accepting `90 lakh for a posting, when he was the railway minister, probably influenced the voters. AAP candidate Gul Panag also took away some of these votes.",1

899,"Kangana Ranaut attacks Manikarnika co-director Krish after NTR biopic’s failure, says time to question ‘every vulture’Kangana Ranaut has criticised Manikarnika co-director Krrish as his NTR biopic failed to perform at the box office, saying ‘now is the time to question every vulture who was out for my blood’.Actor Kangana Ranaut has constantly been in headlines for her film Manikarnika: The Queen of Jhansi which eventually entered the Rs 100 crore club at the domestic box office. Earlier, co-director Krish had accused the actor of hijacking the film and a bitter exchange of words had followed the film’s release. Krish had reportedly left Manikarnika to direct the NTR biopic titled NTR Mahanayakudu, which failed at the box office.This has now given the actor one more reason to criticise the filmmaker. On being asked about the same, Kangana told Pinkvilla, “Yes, I also read about zero recovery of NTR, it’s called black mark on the actor’s career. My heart goes out to Balakrishna sir who trusted Krish and put so much at stake, but for me now is the time to question every vulture who was out for my blood, who attacked and harassed me for taking charge of a troubled situation and making a critically acclaimed and commercially successful film (Manikarnika), but what is shameful is that Krish and some paid media ran a sabotage campaign against a martyr’s biopic. Honestly, I am embarrassed of them, our freedom fighters gave blood for some thankless fools.”The actor was part of several controversies and had accused Bollywood celebrities of not supporting her during the film’s release. It seems she has finally found support in senior actors including Anupam Kher and Paresh Rawal who have slammed people on social media for making fun of a behind-the-scene video featuring Kangana on a mechanical horse during the shooting of battle scenes for Manikarnika.While her sister Rangoli had spoken up in her defence and justified how an actor’s close-up is shot just like all Bollywood and Hollywood films, now Paresh Rawal and Anupam Kher have come out in her support.Paresh Rawal took to Twitter to justify Rangoli’s stand and sharing how scenes are shot with the help of special effects. He tweeted, “According to these dimwits and pinheads they believe that superman and Batman in Hollywood films are actually flying and it’s not some camera trick or CG effects ...!”Anupam had earlier called out a user for criticising Kangana for not using a real horse to shoot some battle scenes. He had tweeted, “How much venom this man has against a self made actress #KanganaRanaut!! This is called ‘acting’ idiot. Actors all over the world do that. That is their job. She will be remembered for decades for her hard work in movies. While you got your fifteen minute fame by using her name.”Earlier, co-director Krish had accused the actor of hijacking the film and a bitter exchange of words had followed the film’s release. Kangana had earlier called out Alia Bhatt and Aamir Khan for not supporting her films, claiming she always does the same for others. Kangana said while she attended the screenings of Dangal, Secret Superstar and Raazi, Alia and Aamir did not return the favour.According to a report in Pinkvilla, Kangana said she made a phonecall to Alia and told her to ‘grow a spine’. She said, “I suggested that she (Alia) grows some spine and support an important film about woman empowerment and nationalism....if she doesn’t have a voice of her own and her existence is all about being KJo (Karan Johar) puppet then I don’t consider her successful... I told her if she is only focusing on earning bucks and not raise a voice, then her success has no value.... hope she understands the true meaning of success and her responsibilities, Napo gang life is simply restricted to give and take favours hope she rises above that.”",0

The excluded professionals include doctors, engineers, lawyers, chartered accountants and architects registered with professional bodies, the agriculture ministry said in the operational guidelines for the Pradhan Mantri KIsan SAmman Nidhi (PM-KISAN) scheme announced in the interim budget on February 1. The government will not cover those with a monthly pension of Rs 10,000 or more. The scheme promises to pay Rs 6,000 a year in three instalments to farmers who own up to 2 hectares of land, with the first instalment due for the period from December 1 to March 31. States have been given a deadline of February 25 to submit lists of eligible farmers. The cut-off date for eligible farmers is February 1 of this year, after which new owners of agricultural land won’t be considered for the next five years. “However, benefit will be allowed in those cases where transfer of ownership of cultivable land takes place on account of succession due to death of the landowner,” according to a document on the website of the Department of Agriculture Cooperation & Farmers Welfare. An alternative mechanism will be set up for the northeast, where land ownership is often community based, making it difficult to select eligible famers. The mechanism for eligibility of northeast farmers will be developed and approved by a committee of Union ministers from the Ministry of Development of North East Region (DoNER), Ministry of Land Resources, Agriculture Minister and the state chief ministers or their ministerial representative, based on the proposal by the northeast states concerned. The Centre has asked the states to identify and designate a sponsoring bank for this scheme. “States may consider designating the same bank being used for transfer of fund for MNRGES as sponsoring bank for this scheme,” it said. It said the designated bank should have well-developed IT systems with the capabilities of integration with the web portal of the scheme and Public FinancialManagement System (PFMS).",0

Sharma counts himself as one of them.“The Trans bill is the single biggest mistake of the [ruling] BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party],” he said. “If it is passed, it will make life very difficult for us.” The bill, however, was not taken up by the Rajya Sabha during the final session of Parliament.Sharma, who identifies as a transman, cannot get a voter ID card made, because, in a conundrum that is peculiar to the transgender community, he does not have “proof” of his gender identity. The two identifying documents that he possesses, the Aadhaar card and PAN (Permanent Account Number) card, are in the female gender he was assigned at birth. “I am not making a voter ID card right now because I know that it will be difficult to change the gender and name on it. First I’ll get my Aadhaar and PAN card corrected, and then I’ll get all these made.” Does he know what needs to be done? “Yes, main aapko batata hoon (let me tell you about it),” he said, narrating the procedure. When will he do it? Soon, he replies.",0
906,"Lok Sabha elections 2019: BJP to go it alone in HaryanaThe Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) would go it alone in Haryana in the forthcoming Lok Sabha elections, party’s co-incharge for parliamentary polls in the state, Vishwas Sarang, said.Sarang, who was in Kurukshetra on Saturday to attend a workshop of party workers from Kurukshetra, Karnal, Ambala and Sonepat Lok Sabha constituencies, said the decision about party candidates would be taken by the party’s central leadership after discussion with state leaders.Exuding confidence that the BJP would win all the 10 Lok Sabha seats in Haryana, Sarang said the results of Jind assembly byelection had proved that opposition parties, especially the Congress, had lost ground in the state.He, however, parried question on why the BJP had not taken action against Kurukshetra MP Raj Kumar Saini, who has formed a separate party.Earlier, addressing party workers in the Kurukshetra University’s auditorium, chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar said Prime Minister Narendra Modi will address 11 crore party workers in the country on February 28. BJP’S national president Amit Shah would hold a meeting of party workers at Hisar on February 25 and on March 2, a bike rally would be taken out in every assembly constituency of the state, he said.Without taking any name, Khattar alleged that many Congress leaders were facing corruption cases. “Leaders alone cannot be blamed for corruption. Government officers and employees also play an equal role,” he added.“But we have managed to eliminate corruption, ”the CM said.Khattar and BJP’S Haryana in-charge Anil Jain also launched a mobile app of ‘Digital BJP Haryana’ on the occasion.",0
907,"Maha-­Metro faces land acquisition hurdles in old Pune or ‘peth’ areasMaharashtra Metro Rail Corporation Ltd (Maha-Metro) is facing opposition from residents in the old Pune or ‘peth’ areas for acquiring land for construction of Metro stations at Budhwar peth and Mandai.Maha-Metro had already identified 322 entities whose properties will need to be acquired in these areas for carrying out the construction work. Brijesh Dixit, managing director, Maha-Metro said, “It is natural to face opposition for land acquisition. No one is willing to give their property. However, the government needs to acquire the lands to complete the projects in the larger interest.”Dixit said there are 205 Metros working in the world and all of them face similar problems when it comes to land acquisition. However, Maha-Metro is planning to give “good compensation” to the project affected people and is keeping all options open such as giving cash component or alternate property at another location, and TDR (transfer of development rights) for handing over the properties.“This is a crowed area and Maha-Metro will need these properties for erecting the metro stations. The metro corridors will not need land acquisition,” he said.The affected properties have been surveyed by Maha-Metro with the help of third party as well its project officials. The authorities have also assured to rehabilitate the affected people in the same locality. PMC has one plot in the city area which can be developed and all the affected families can be rehabilitated in the same locality, he said.Dixit said Maha Metro will ensure that no injustice would be done to anyone during the land acquisition process.Railway ministry gives approvalAfter defence ministry, the railway ministry has given its approval for crossings over railway lines on the Pune Metro route and connectivity with Khadki, Shivajinagar and Pune stations.Brijesh Dixit, managing director, maharashtra metro rail corporation said, “Pune is lucky as it is getting speedy permissions for the Metro project. After the defence ministry’s recent nod to hand over 10 acres land at Khadki, Dapodi and Range Hills, the railway ministry has given its approval for crossing the railway lines near Kamgar Putala and connecting of metro stations with railway stations at Khadki, Shivajinagar and Pune Railway station.The defence ministry has cleared the Pune Metro right of way permission as also the land transfer proposal for Metro stations,” he said.The Maha Metro’s Pimpri-Chinchwad to Swargate Metro corridor is passing from the Khadki Cantonment area for which defence land is required for parking and construction of railway stations at Khadki, Dapodi and at Range Hills. Land is also required from the defence ministry for erecting the metro corridor of 1.3 km from Khadki to Range Hills. Maha Metro had submitted its proposal to the defence ministry six months ago and was continuously following it up. With the clearances having arrived, the work on the metro corridor will now be speeded up, he said.",1

909,"Major intersections in Delhi death traps for pedestriansMajor intersections in Delhi are turning into death traps for pedestrians. With the rising number of vehicles and a lack of infrastructure for at-grade (at the surface level) crossings, the number of deaths involving pedestrians continues its steep rise every year.According to Delhi Police estimates, of the 1,604 people killed in road accidents last year, around 40% were pedestrians.(Picture for representation)Major intersections in Delhi are turning into death traps for pedestrians. With the rising number of vehicles and a lack of infrastructure for at-grade (at the surface level) crossings, the number of deaths involving pedestrians continues its steep rise every year. According to Delhi Police estimates, of the 1,604 people killed in road accidents last year, around 40% were pedestrians.The task of crossing at intersectionsCrossing busy intersections is an uphill task most pedestrians face on a regular basis. The art of racing to the other side of the road in a fraction of a second before the signal turns red for one section, and green for the other, is something that Delhiites have mastered over the years.An estimate by the Indian Road Congress (IRC) shows an average pedestrian in Delhi takes around seven to eight minutes to cross a busy intersection from end-to-end.This is because the signal timings often ignore those who mean to reach their final destination. After crossing each carriageway, pedestrians have to make a pit-stop for at least two minutes on dividers before they get to cross again. With proper infrastructure, this time can be reduced to three minutes, road safety experts said.They maintained that at intersections, signal timings should be adjusted with the average time taken by a pedestrian to cross the intersection from one end to the other kept in mind. Any breaks will only result in people jumping in front of vehicles off-turn and ending up risking their lives.Sahil Kumar, a bank employee working in Rohini’s Sector 18, said that during the peak morning traffic, he often has to wave at vehicles to slow down so that he can cross the road.“Most drivers end up hurling abuse at you for suddenly jumping on the road, waving your hand like a traffic police officer. But what option do we have? Waiting for these vehicles to stop will mean waiting for at least 15-20 minutes,” Kumar said. He added that the installation of pedestrian signals will give people like him some breather.“We constantly have drives to educate and fine drivers who stop their vehicles beyond the stop line, eating up on the zebra crossing for pedestrians. Safe roads are everyone’s right,” said joint commissioner of police (traffic) Alok Kumar. He also said that regular meetings are conducted with the road-owning agencies to come up with newer ways to make safe walking spaces for pedestrians.A study conducted by the IRC in 2016 proved that the presence of pedestrian signals on busy roads made people feel safer and decreased fatalities. It also showed pedestrians were willing to wait longer at such signals because of an assurance of safe passage when the lights go green.Lack of pedestrian infrastructureIn a 2013 study by Geetam Tiwari from Indian Institute of Technology (Delhi), the pattern of road accidents across major cities in the country over a span of five years was analysed, and it was confirmed that in the national capital, pedestrian deaths comprised at least 47% of all fatalities — the second highest in India after Mumbai.The reason for this alarming trend can be seen in the way the city’s roads are being designed. Despite studies proving pedestrian tendencies to cross the road at-grade, road-owning agencies are doing little to facilitate safe road crossing and walking facilities for them. The priority is on vehicles, which are the centre of the way the city’s roads are planned, experts said.Tiwari said India has been upgrading its highways with dividers, four- and six-lane roads and expressways since 2000. Yet, deaths due to road accidents continue to rise by 9%-10% each year.“The design completely ignores the requirements of walkers, bicyclists, two-wheeler users, even animal carts and other slow-moving traffic. We need to relook our car-centric road designs,” she said.As cities expand, so does vehicular traffic, but all emphasis is on ensuring better movement for cars, and so “cities are becoming hostile to pedestrians,” she said.Sample this. At the crossing outside the gates of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) on Sri Aurobindo Marg, despite the high pedestrian footfall of patients and their caretakers, there aren’t many avenues for people to cross over to the other side of the road safely, without having to wait endlessly.At the pedestrian signal at the gate, the lack of police presence sucks out any deterrence for speeding vehicles to give way to those looking to cross the road, and the apathy of road-owning agencies can be seen in the barely visible zebra crossing. Experts said that for government agencies, on most roads the only road-crossing facility is a gap between the grilles, through which a person or two can squeeze in.The solutionsTiwari said public spaces will improve if road designs move beyond the car-centric approach. “We need to change the way we design our roads and ensure better enforcement of rules,” she said. Experts stress the need to streamline the road geometry, bring the stop-line closer and make the intersection compact. “This will reduce the distance pedestrians have to walk and give them a sense of direction. We often find wide intersections that pedestrians are unable to cross in one go,” Amit Bhatt, director integrated transport, WRI India, maintained.Table-top crossings at slip roads can bring down the speed of vehicles and provide a smooth crossing facility to pedestrians. “Pedestrians prefer to cross at-grade. A majority of intersections are not well-designed. It is important that we factor in their requirements while redesigning our intersections. There is a need to provide refuge islands wherever possible,” Bhatt said.Also, government awareness programmes on road safety over the last 40 years have made little dent in improving road safety. The world over, research shows that individual behaviour cannot be changed without changing the physical environment in which traffic operates, and ensuring better enforcement of rules.The disadvantaged section of senior citizens and differently abled must be catered to. In most developed countries, provisions of pelican signals are made for the benefit of senior citizens, school children and differently abled, who can turn the pedestrian lights green to cross roads safely",0

They robbed him of his phone, smartwatch and wallet and forced him to withdraw money from ATM. (Shutterstock)Trying to help out an accident victim came at a high price for 24-year-old Rishabh Mandal who was duped, robbed of his valuables, and held captive for over two hours on Friday night.According to Mandal, he was on his way home in Patel Nagar, Delhi, when the incident occurred, near the Noida City Centre Metro station.“I got off an auto-rickshaw around 8pm at the service lane near the Metro station, when a man in his mid twenties approached me. He said his younger sister had met with an accident and was trapped in a car, and said he needed my help to pull her out of the car. I accompanied him to a street nearby to help him out,” Mandal, who is preparing for competitive exams, said.He said they were followed by another person, which was when he realised something was amiss.“The person who was following us asked what was going on. That’s when the tone of the man who asked for my help changed. I realised something was amiss and tried to leave. However, a third person blocked me from behind. One of them pulled out a gun and another held a knife to my throat. They took my phone, smartwatch and wallet. I didn’t have much cash on me so they asked me to withdraw money from any ATM. When I told them that I didn’t have money in the account, they asked me to arrange it and threatened me with dire consequences if I did not comply,” Mandal said.He said a couple of passersby were around. “But I was so scared that I could not approach them and anyone passing by would not have guessed what was going on. I called my elder brother for help. When he didn’t take the call, I called my younger brother and asked him to transfer money to my account,” he said, adding that the accused also suggested several excuses he could give his brother to encourage him to transfer the money.“I withdrew Rs 5,000, which he transferred to me and handed it over. They didn’t come into the ATM kiosk with me for fear of getting captured in the CCTV camera. When they realised that I was scared and was complying with their demands, they got greedier. They took my phone and asked my brother to send more money. They took nearly Rs 28,000 in multiple transactions,” he said.Mandal alleged that he tried to flee but the accused held him captive. “They were manhandling me the whole time and abusing me. They even threatened to kill me. Finally, around 10.10pm, when one of them was on his phone and the other two were talking, I decided to flee. They followed me, but I came upon a wedding party where I asked a few people for help. They gave me Rs 100 and dropped me at the Golf Course Metro station from where I came back home and filed an e-FIR,” said Mandal.Based on his complaint, a case of robbery (Section 392) under the Indian Penal Code was registered at the Sector 24 police station.“An investigation is ongoing in the case, and we will nab the accused soon,” Mithlesh Updhyay, station house officer, Sector 24 police station, said.",0

Gauri Mahadik (32), all set to join the Officers' Training Academy (OTA) at Chennai, said instead of just mourning her husband's death, she wanted to pay a befitting tribute to him by wearing his stars and uniform. Major Mahadik, who had joined the Army in 2012 and commissioned in the 7th Battalion of Bihar Regiment, died in the fire at his camp in Tawang near the Indo-China border in in December 2017. Post-completion of 49-week training at the OTA, Gauri Mahadik, a qualified company secretary and law graduate who recently topped the Service Selection Board (SSB) exam in the widow category, will be inducted into the Army as a Lieutenant by March 2020. ""After my husband's death, I was thinking what to do next...I thought I can not just sit and cry. So I decided that I should do something for him and make him proud. ""I decided to follow his footsteps and with a determination that I will wear his stars and uniform, started preparing for SSB examination,"" said Mahadik while talking to PTI from Virar, a distant suburb of Mumbai, over the phone.

919,"Ministry of Railways plans upgradation of 90 stations ahead of next general electionsModernised railway stations is something Indians have been long promised but it remains a pipe dream. Hopes were raised, yet again, in February when Finance Minister Arun Jaitley announced that 600 railway stations across the country had been picked for modernisation. All a part of the whopping Rs 1.48 trillion allocation to the railways - the highest ever for the sector - in the Modi government's last Budget before the next general elections.But then one remembered that a year earlier, then Railway Minister Suresh Prabhu had launched the first phase of what the ministry called the ""World's largest Station Redevelopment Program"", comprising 23 major railway stations. The idea was to redevelop the stations through the public-private-partnership (PPP) model, where the railways will provide approximately 140 acres of encroachment free land to the developers on a 45 year lease and hence the project would generally be cost neutral to the Railways. Moreover, according to a statement from the ministry at the time, the Rs 1 lakh crore program would benefit more than 100 cities and 16 million passengers per day across the country.Things did not quite pan out that way due to muted private investor interest. Undeterred, the Railways recently came out with a list of 68 stations earmarked for a facelift through its own resources before the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. The cost is pegged at Rs 5,000 crore. ""We can't wait for private investors anymore. We'll redevelop these stations on our own and could monetise them later through commercial exploitation,"" a top rail ministry official earlier told The Economic Times.The new list includes some of the busiest stations in the country like the Old Delhi railway station, Guwahati, Howrah, Patna, Allahabad, Udaipur, Haridwar, Pune, Bengaluru, Ambala, Chennai Egmore and Bhubaneshwar.The redevelopment plan has reportedly been assigned to the zonal railways with a one year deadline for completion. According to the daily, all the shortlisted railway stations will get state-of-the-art amenities, including elevators, swanky waiting room, a modern passenger announcement system, new platforms, shopping complex and airport-like entry and exit. The redevelopment will be closely monitored by the general managers of the respective zones and the divisional railway managers.""While doing this (redevelopment), efforts would be made to showcase local culture or history to reflect in the station facade. For instance Aurangabad station is to be developed on lines of Ajantha or Ellora, Agra station is to be developed on lines of Taj Mahal, Ujjain station is to be developed on lines of Mahakaleshwar temples,"" the ministry said in a statement in March.Apart from the 68 stations announced by the Railways, the redevelopment of the Habibganj railway station in Madhya Pradesh and the Gandhinagar railway station in Gujarat are already racing towards completion and seem on course to meet the December 2018 and January 2019 deadlines, respectively.These two stations have hogged the headlines of late given the impressive list of features they will pack. In case you missed the buzz, the Habibganj station will have a large waiting area comprising over 600 benches with neat and clean toilets and commercial hubs. Of the total Rs 450 crore allocated for the redevelopment of the Habibganj railway station, Rs 100 will be spent on improving the infrastructure, while the rest of the amount will be spent on building glass structures and facilities for food, entertainment, and the waiting area. The Indian Railway Stations Development Corporation Ltd. (IRSDC) is also working on other ideas like installing video game zones and virtual museums to make the station more passenger-friendly and commercially viable.The Gandhinagar railway station, scheduled to be inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi before the Vibrant Gujarat Summit in January 2019, is a special purpose vehicle (SPV) between the IRSDC and the Gujarat government. Around Rs 250 crore have been allocated for its redevelopment and the centre of attraction here will be a 300-room 5-star hotel built 22 metres above the ground, while the railway track will pass underneath it.

It is famous for its natural heritage that is the home for several wildlife animals, including 43 tigers, 15 panthers and around 1800 wild dogs.With an area of 625.40 sq km, the project includes Tadoba National, created in 1955 with an area of 116.55 sq km and Andhari wildlife sanctuary, created in 1986 with an area of 508.85 kms.It said that the tiger conservation in Tadoba national park was commendable for the last one and half decades. The tiger population has been increasing, though slowly, during the period. Population of the big cat in the area was 36 in 1994 census which has now increased by 43 in the last census.In view of its good track record, the Ministry of Environment and Forests also included the tiger reserve in its pilot project for mapping wildlife sanctuaries and parks by the Wildlife Institute of India, Dehradun. Rs 1.39-crore was sanctioned for the pilot project that would be completed in 36 months. Out of the five sites selected for this pilot project, three were tiger reserves - Tadoba-Andhari, Dudhwa and Corbett. The identified targets included generation of satellite data and securing the survey of India topographic maps.Talking to Hindustan Times, B Majumder, the PCCF (wildlife), and Maharashtra state said that by providing mobile and landline network, the park would certainly be able to benefit the tourists and forest personnel who are working there for wildlife conservation. “We are expecting more tourists after starting this facility,” he further claimed and informed that the BSNL was exploring to provide such facility in the locality.Meanwhile, the MTDC with the help of ministry and Railway and the ministry of Tourism is planning to start an exclusive narrow gauge vintage train from Nagpur to Nagbhir (near Tadoba) for tourists, an answer to the to Nagbhir (near Tadoba) for tourists, an answer to the Palace of Wheels in Rajasthan. The plan, which was postponed because of numerous reasons, would begin from January next.",1

923,"More MPs likely to quit parties in key Brexit weekThe prospect of more MPs quitting Conservative and Labour parties hung heavy over Westminster as Prime Minister Theresa May braced for a key week in parliament with a little over a month to go for the UK to leave the European Union on March 29.Labour deputy leader Tom Watson admitted on Sunday the party had to change to ensure more MPs do not take the extreme step of resigning, while May’s cabinet was under strain to maintain collective responsibility with three ministers openly, and others covertly, toeing new lines.Three cabinet ministers - business secretary Greg Clark, justice secretary David Gauke and works and pensions secretary Amber Rudd have already favoured extension to Article 50 to delay Brexit beyond March 29.May has been cautioned by senior advisors that she cannot sack ministers who vote this week to delay Brexit without causing a further rupture within her party, given the growing number of ministers and MPs reportedly in favour of delaying it.May used a party convention in Oxford to reiterate her position that has led to much hand-wringing inside and outside her party, as well as in Brussels: “Our focus to deliver Brexit must be absolute”.“We must not, and I will not, frustrate what was the largest democratic exercise in this country’s history. In the very final stages of this process, the worst thing we could do is lose our focus,” she said.As the newly-formed The Independent Group attracted funds from small and major donors worth “tens of thousands of pounds”, as former Labour MP Chuka Umunna put it, he called upon the British public to join the formation for a new kind of politics.He wrote in the Sunday Mirror: “This week we have come together in the national interest, to say ‘enough is enough’. We have each put everything on the line to give something new a try. Believe me, it wasn’t an easy decision for any of us”.“We don’t yet know the destination where the path we’ve taken will lead us. But what me and my Independent Group colleagues are absolutely clear about is that we cannot and must not recreate the old parties with their tribalism and incompetence”.",0
924,"More Staff For Railway Protection Force In Kashmir After Pulwama AttackThe Railway Protection Force (RPF) has increased the number of its personnel in Kashmir following the terror attack in Pulwama to ensure the safety of train passengers and to protect railway property, a senior official of the force said.A total of 40 CRPF personnel were killed and five injured on February 14 in a terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir when a Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammad suicide bomber rammed a vehicle carrying over 100 kg of explosives into their bus in Pulwama district.""We had a meeting with the Ministry of Home Affairs yesterday where the decision was taken to increase the presence of RPF in the region,"" said RPF DG Arun Kumar.""The chairman railway board also had a detailed security briefing with all zonal and divisional RPF officers on the security of railways. It was decided that a company of RPF will be sent to Kashmir for additional security,"" he said.While four companies of the RPF are stationed in Kashmir, one more, with 125 personnel, will be airlifted from Jammu to the area, he added.",1
925,"MoS Railways dubs Railway Protection Force as 'toothless', demands more power for it Dubbing the RPF as a ""toothless"" organisation, Minister of State for Railways Manoj Sinha on Wednesday strongly pitched for more powers for it even as his senior ministerial colleague Piyush Goyal played down his concerns, asserting that regardless of a law they should move on with their work Goyal also said an amendment to the existing Railways Act was only a ""technicality"", and urged the Railway Protection Force (RPF) and the Government Railway Police (GRP) to work together to secure railways and passengers. Speaking at a conference on security of railways, both Sinha and RPF Director General Arun Kumar pushed for handing over the registration, enquiry and detection of passenger-related crimes on board running trains to the force. Currently, even if a crime is detected by the RPF, the case has to be handed over to the GRP for further enquiry. RPF is a toothless organisation. It is involved in security, but has no powers. Despite ability and efforts, the RPF has not got the powers it deserves. However, it is blamed for everything that happens on railway premises. But the reality is that other than taking care (of railway property), RPF has no real powers. An amendment in the law, I personally feel, is the need of the hour,"" Sinha said However, Goyal asserted that ""whether the law is changed or not, whether the GRP does it or the RPF, these are all technicalities. We have to decide that we need to work together to secure passengers. Then law will not come in the way."" The RPF DG also highlighted how his force can leverage its inherent advantage of having an all India jurisdiction to prevent and detect crime in moving trains. Since the jurisdiction of an RPF posts cuts across jurisdiction of many police stations, it has an advantage of identifying place of occurrence, quick registration of the case and subsequent detection, Kumar added. ""Therefore, we may consider empowering RPF to register, investigate and detect passenger luggage thefts so that the state police can concentrate on checking serious crimes like robbery, dacoity, rape, murder and focus its efforts in maintenance of law and order in railway premises. ""A draft bill for amendment in Railways Act to empower RPF to register, enquire and prosecute cases of passenger luggage theft and crime against women has been approved to be sent to the cabinet for further legislative action,"" he said.

926,"MoU Signed For Development Of Railway Infrastructure In TelanganaIn the august presence of Chairman, Railway Board Shri A.K. Mital an Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between Ministry of Railways and State Government of Telangana for “Formation of Joint Venture Companies for Development of Railway Infrastructure in the State of Telangana” has been signed.On the event of Signing Ceremony, Chairman Railway Board Shri A. K. Mital, Member Engineering Shri V. K. Gupta, Member Staff Shri Pradip Kumar, Secretary Railway Board Shri R. K. Verma and other Board Members and Senior Officials were present. On behalf of the Railway Ministry Shri Ved Prakash Dudeja, Executive Director/Works signed the MoU whereas on behalf of Government of Telangana, Shri Sunil Sharma, Principal Secretary, Department of Transport, Roads & Buildings, Govt. of Telangana signed the MoU. Dr. Shashank Goel, Resident Commissioner, Govt. of Telangana was present among others. The MoU was signed in the backdrop of Railway Minister’s Budget announcement regarding setting up of Joint Ventures with States for focused project development, resource mobilization, land acquisition, project implementation and monitoring of critical rail projects.Speaking on the occasion, Chairman Railway Board stated that Railways has a big shelf of projects valuing about 3.5 lakh crore. Last year, Railways had sanctioned additional lines of nine thousand kilometres. There has always been lot of expectations from various States for new railway lines/lands. Thus, to meet the demands of the States, a Cabinet note was got approved for formation of JV Companies. He stated that 17 States have already consented for formation of JV Companies in their respective States and 5 States have already signed MoUs with Railway Ministry in this regard which are Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, Odisha. He stated that today’s MoU will help in putting the execution of railways projects on fast track.  He stated that this will also help to take into account the priorities of the States because these projects will be finalized in consultation with the States as there would be offices from State Governments as well as Railways in the new Company which will be formed.  He stated that this is very welcome step which takes the partnership of State and Centre together to take railway projects on very fast pace. Salient Features of the MoU:-  In view of the growing demands for railway lines in various states and huge requirement of funds to execute them, Minister for Railways announced in his budget speech regarding setting up of Joint Ventures with states for focused project development, resource mobilization, land acquisition, project implementation and monitoring of critical rail projects. 17 State Governments consented for formation of Joint Venture Companies in collaboration with the Ministry of Railways for development of rail infrastructure in their respective States. Draft MoU were sent to these State Governments and discussions were also held with them to clarify various provisions of the MoU.MoUs have already been signed by the Ministry of Railways with the State Governments of Odisha, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Kerala and Chhattisgarh.Today, MoUs are being signed with the State Governments of Telangana. This signing of MOU is going to be a stepping stone for formation of JV companies.The MoU envisages formation of a Joint Venture companies having 51% stakes of the respective State Government and 49% stakes of Ministry of Railways. Thus, the JV companies shall be fully owned by the Government. The companies will primarily identify projects and possible financing avenues in addition to Govt of India and the State Governments. After finances for a project are tied up, project specific SPVs or special purpose vehicles shall be formed. These SPVs can have other stake holders from Industries, Central PSUs, and State PSUs etc. However, the JV companies shall be mandatory stake holders with minimum 26% shares in the SPVs.The ministry of Railways will sign a concession agreement of 30 years with the project SPV for safe and sound operation, revenue sharing and providing technical & marketing logistics to the SPV. The revenue sharing shall be based on already established formula being used for inter zonal apportionment of revenue.The most important aspect of this MoU is that the ownership of the land shall vest with the SPVs which are a departure from previous practice. This will give financial leverage to the company to exploit commercial potential of the land. This is likely to result in making project viable which are otherwise not viable.At the end of concession period, the railways will have option to take over the assets at a nominal price. This is largely in line with average codal life of the assets as most of the assets will need large scale replacement after 30 years.Indian Railways has been playing a major role in national integration by connecting the remotest places and bringing people closer to each other. Railways receive a large number of demands for network expansion as a railway line acts as an engine of growth for the area it serves.However, Railways have a large shelf of ongoing New Line, Gauge Conversion and Doubling projects needing about Rs 3.5 lakh crores to complete. We have been trying to meet the aspirations of public within limited availability of funds.To expedite the projects, Railways have been trying to mobilize resources through other than Gross Budgetary Support. However, on the initiative of Minister for Railways Sh. Suresh Prabhu, Indian Railways have tied up funds for critical capacity enhancement project of doubling, third line, electrification etc. A MoU was signed with LIC of India and we have already taken first tranche of Rs 2000 Cr for these projects. This tied up loan will ensure dedicated and assured funding for such critical projects.Indian Railways have targeted to commission 2000 Km New Lines, 4000 Km Gauge Conversion and 11000 Km Doubling/Tripling/ Quadrupling projects over 5 years i.e. from 2015-16 to 2019-20. In 2015-16, we had kept quite ambitious target of commissioning 2500 Km Broad Gauge track. It is a matter of great satisfaction that we are poised to not only achieve these targets but to surpass them. We have already commissioned about 1300 Km Broad Gauge track till December, 2015 against 800 Km track commissioned in the corresponding period of the previous year (Due to monsoons, major commissioning takes place in the last quarter of the financial year).Formation of Joint Venture Companies with the State Governments will go a long way in faster commissioning of critical rail infrastructure projects as it will not only help in mobilization of funds but also in facilitating various clearances and land acquisition.",1

The handset instead uses light sensors to scan the veins in a user’s hand or to recognise their face.The phone’s front-facing camera, which uses a sensor chip developed by Germany’s Infineon Technologies , can scan in three dimensions - making it more secure than existing biometric methods of unlocking phones such as fingerprints.LG product evangelist David Montanya told a launch event it would be harder to ‘spoof’ than the FaceID feature used in Apple’s iPhone X because the vein structure in a user’s hand has less than one chance in a billion of being the same as anyone else’s.Users can also activate features with gestures - for example to play or pause a song or video, or adjust the volume, by twisting their fingers, emulating the character played by Tom Cruise in science-fiction detective thriller Minority Report.LG did not set release dates or announce prices for the new phones, but said the 5G model should hit stores in the first half of the year.",0
928,"Mumbai rail roko | Highlights: Protest called off, but agitators warn of another stir; train services resumeCommuters in Mumbai travelling on the Central Railway (CR)?struggled on Tuesday, after railway apprentices decided to protest against the railway recruitment system by resorting to rail roko between Matunga and Dadar railway stations on the main line during the morning rush hours.The railways select and appoint apprentices for various technical jobs, to be done in their various workshops across India. Earlier, these apprentices were absorbed into the railways as they got preference during recruitments. However, in 2016, the railway ministry decided to stop this and offer them just a 20% quota. Since then, ,many apprentices have not been able to get railway jobs and have been staging protests.Protesters on Tuesday blocked all the CR?lines, so both the slow and fast local train services ahead of Matunga have been shut completely, forcing commuters to walk on tracks. “Due to some agitation between Matunga and Dadar, rail traffic has been affected between Matunga and CSMT,” said Sunil Udasi, chief public relations officer, CR.The agitation started after 7am, and went on for around three-and-a-half hours.Here are the highlights:11.51am: Protesters head to Bandra (east), likely to meet MNS?chief Raj Thackeray at MIG Club.11.30am: Tracks cleared and trains running.

929,"Mumbai railway train commute is as noisy as an alarm clock ringing constantlyHear this. Your daily train commute on the Mumbai suburban railway is as noisy as an alarm clock ringing constantly, according to a study. While the study revealed that the Western Railway is the noisiest at 119.1 dB — as loud as a steel factory, the Central Railway is quieter, but only marginally, at 91.6dB.Non-governmental organisation (NGO) Awaaz Foundation measured noise using decibel meters from an old train between Bandra station and Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus (CST) on the harbour line, a new train between CST and Thane station and both old and new trains between Churchgate and Virar stations on the western line. While Virar station was the noisiest on the western line, Byculla station and Mahim junction were the noisiest on the harbour and central lines respectively.“Railway noise levels have been a huge source of stress, which has not been recognised up till now. After our readings were made public, complaints have been pouring in about how much it affects their daily life. This is just the beginning and there is a lot more to be done to reduce this source of noise pollution,” said Sumaira Abdulali, convener, Awaaz Foundation. “All types of travel are an integral part of people’s lives. The Centre needs to restrict noise levels on the suburban railways, like it has been done by the Airport Authority of India, which made the Mumbai airport a silent one.”Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) officials said that the readings were a cause for concern and pose a serious threat to people’s lives as they are exposed to such levels daily. “We will be raising the issue with the Union environment ministry and the railway ministry as noise readings close to 120dB is dangerous for even healthy people if they are exposed to it daily,” said D Saha, additional director, CPCB.",1
930,"Mumbai rain: Late trains, traffic snarls, water, scary wall collapse, et al. Mumbai came to a standstill on Monday -- just a few days after the onset of monsoon -- as overnight rains led to the usual chaos of delayed trains, water-logged roads, horrific traffic snarls, and a rather scary wall collapse in a central neighbourhood of the city. Four people have died in the last 24 hours in the city and its suburbs. A 15-year-old died after falling into an open pit in Malad. Another 13-year-old was killed in a wall collapse in thane. Two died yesterday when a tree collapsed on them near Azad Maidan in South Mumbai. A large part of the boundary wall of a plush apartment complex in Wadala collapsed and subsided in the morning, burying nearly a dozen cars. The damaged cars, mostly belonging to residents of the complex -- Lloyds  Estate -- were stuck in debris.Local trains, the city's life line, were running behind schedule as usual, at the hint of the first heavy rains this season. Water-logging was reported from low-lying areas and office-goers and vehicles found it difficult to navigate roads in large parts of the city.  Meanwhile, Mumbai's civic body officials placed pumps on stand-by in neighbourhoods that are prone to water-logging.  The Indian Meteorological Department has said that heavy to very heavy rains are expected to continue.Two people died and five were injured on Sunday after a tree fell on them near Metro Cinema at MG Road in South Mumbai's Marine Lines area, according to news agency ANI.A 13-year-old boy was killed and his parents were injured when an adjacent wall collapsed on their house at Wadol village in Ambernath taluka of Thane around 2:15 am today, the district civic body's regional disaster management cell chief Santosh Kadam told news agency PTI. In another incident, a 65-feet compound wall of a housing complex in Thane city collapsed this morning, crushing two cars and another vehicle, he said.  On Sunday, Mumbai recorded the highest amount of rainfall at 110.80 mm between 8:30 am and 4:30 pm, a Met department official said.",1
931,"Mumbai stampede: Tragedy is fallout of misplaced prioritiesIt is a sad irony. The stampede took place at Elphinstone Road station on the day railway minister Piyush Goyal was to visit Mumbai and get a first-hand experience of the struggle millions of daily commuters face as they commute between work place and home in overcrowded trains. In fact, the railway officials were also considering an event to rename Elphinstone Road station during Goyal’s visit to Mumbai on Friday, but it was somehow put on hold.For the past few years, commuters’ associations and activists have been raising the issue of overcrowded foot overbridges and narrow staircases at Parel and Elphinstone Road stations and warning the authorities that there could be a stampede-like situation here. The Hindustan Times published several reports on the subject. A plan for makeover of the two stations on two different suburban lines (central and western) joined by a narrow foot overbridge was prepared a few years ago. However, typically it was not given priority. On the other hand, a political demand to rename Elphinstone Road station as Prabhadevi was taken up on urgent basis and a notification was issued by the railway ministry in no time.Anybody who takes a glance at the two stations during morning and evening peak hours can tell there is an urgent need to rebuild their basic infrastructure. In fact, not just Parel and Elphinstone Road, but some other stations in central Mumbai have been witnessing similar problems. Following the redevelopment of mill land, in which defunct textile mills gave way to skyscrapers housing commercial offices, central Mumbai’s Parel-Worli belt became a commercial hub. Footfall at these stations saw a massive increase. The railway officials, however, are slow to react to the development and the outcome is there to see.Even the Maharashtra government and Mumbai civic body who gave permission for vertical development of central Mumbai should share the blame for the incident. Both the state and city governments were well aware of the development in the area, but did little to upgrade the infrastructure there.The incident also raises questions over the way the suburban railway network is governed by the railway ministry.The railway ministry is taking up projects such as air-conditioned trains, elevated railway corridors and above all, the Rs1,00,000-crore Mumbai-Ahmedabad bullet train. There could be a case for planning for the future, but what about the need to improve and upgrade basic infrastructure at railway stations? Shouldn’t that be a priority?Experts and commuters’ associations have been demanding there should be a separate cadre to handle the suburban train networks at mega cities like Mumbai, as the top railway officers often fail to understand how the Mumbai suburban section, which is used daily by over 7 million commuters, needs to be run. Maybe, it’s time to consider this demand as well.",1

After the approval, we will start identification of land. Banks will also be approached for loan,” said an MRVC official.With the expansion of the suburban railway network, the railway authorities have clubbed major projects under the umbrella of MUTP-3A. Procurement of 210 AC local trains, elevated corridor between CSMT- Panvel, too, are included in it. The project will increase the operational capacity of the western railway, further segregating suburban and long distance traffic up to Virar. It will also provide east-west connectivity to the extended suburbs of Mumbai.",1

Banks will also be approached for loan,” said an MRVC official.With the expansion of the suburban railway network, the railway authorities have clubbed major projects under the umbrella of MUTP-3A. Procurement of 210 AC local trains, elevated corridor between CSMT- Panvel, too, are included in it. The project will increase the operational capacity of the western railway, further segregating suburban and long distance traffic up to Virar. It will also provide east-west connectivity to the extended suburbs of Mumbai.",1

935,"Mumbai: Railways to evict illegal hawkers from entry and exit points of stations, FOBs In a bid to prevent incidents like the Elphinstone station stampede that claimed 23 lives, the railway administration has undertaken a drive to evict illegal hawkers from the entry and exit points of the station as well as from the foot overbridges to ease commuter movement.Twenty-three persons were killed in the stampede on a foot overbridge (FOB) linking two railways stations in Mumbai on Friday during the deadly rush hour. ""Though action against hawkers is undertaken on a regular basis, from October 1, this drive has been intensified with a combined operation launched by the RPF and GRP, and moreover they will also be patrolling the FoBs,"" said chief spokesperson of the Western Railway Ravinder Bhakar.However, passengers and railway representatives want permanent eviction of hawkers and have warned the railway officials that they would report to the Railways Minister if the hawkers return to do business at these spots.Bhakar said Western Railway administration is soon going to demarcate the railway area to stop this menace forever.He said, ""Most of the complaints against hawkers we receive, fall under the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) area where we do not have our administrative control. So we are blamed unnecessarily. Therefore, we have decided to demarcate our periphery and we will keep full vigil within our jurisdiction.""The Central Railway too has launched a drive against illegal hawkers at several stations including Ghatkopar, Kurla, Byculla, Mulund.Eviction of hawkers paved way for smooth movement of commuters near railway stations and on foot overbridges.Senior PRO of Central Railway A K Jain said, ""Though our security forces, keep driving away unauthorised hawkers, they have been now been asked to deal strictly with them.""Rajiv Singal, who has been a member of Railway Users Consultative Committees in Central Railway and Western Railway, however, dubs this exercise of evicting hawkers as merely an ""eyewash"".Singal said, ""This is simply dressing up and no permanent cure. It is showoff because audit team is doing their job and media pressure is working. I can bet you, hawkers will be back again.""""Until and unless, disciplinary action is not taken against the senior RPF officials in whose jurisdiction hawkers operate, nothing is going to change,"" Singal said.T N Dubey, former member of Divisional Railway Users Consultative Committees in Western Railway, said, ""If hawkers come back, we will write to the Railways Minister and draw his attention to the issue.""

939,"Odisha to implement PM-KISAN; farmers to benefit from central and state schemesChief minister Naveen Patnaik’s government had earlier been noncommittal on the PM’s farm intervention scheme as well.By MEERA MOHANTYBHUBANESHWAR: The Odisha government has agreed to implement the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN), deciding to share the first list of beneficiaries under its own farm-intervention programme for the Centre’s cash-transfer scheme. Chief minister Naveen Patnaik’s government, which had refused to implement the Ayushman Bharat central health insurance scheme, had earlier been noncommittal on the PM’s farm intervention scheme as well. The Centre is expected to formally launch the PM-KISAN scheme, announced in the interim budget 2019-20, at a farmers’ conclave in Gorakhpur in Uttar Pradesh on February 24. The onus on identifying beneficiaries for it has been placed with the states. Preoccupied with a state-wide rollout of its own Krushak Assistance for Livelihood and Income Augmentation (KALIA) scheme — it covers sharecroppers and landless agriculture labour as well — the state government had not decided who would qualify for the central scheme. On Thursday, the state announced it would share the list of 12.45 lakh small and marginal farmers who had received the first instalment of Rs 5,000 under the KALIA scheme. These farmers, holding up to 2 hectares of land, in the state now stand to gain an additional Rs 6,000 in three instalments through the year under the PM-KISAN scheme. Addressing a gathering of farmers at Sohela in Bargarh district, Patnaik on Thursday launched the Phase-II of KALIA. The scheme has been praised by economists for not being a loan waiver and including sharecroppers and landless farmers. Those with landholding get an assistance of Rs 25,000 (over five cropping seasons) while sharecroppers and the landless farmers get Rs 12,500 in three instalments. Patnaik’s said: “It is very sad that the Centre’s scheme does not have anything for these neglected and deprived sections (sharecroppers and landless farmers). I have taken up the issue with the Prime Minister and demanded steps for supporting the landless farmers, sharecroppers and agricultural workers and protecting their interests.” He also wanted the assistance to be enhanced from Rs 6,000 to Rs 10,000. The KALIA juggernaut — with posters, billboards, and conventions sweeping the countryside — has practically the entire state machinery occupied even as Patnaik’s Biju Janata Dal aims for a fifth-term in the government. The government’s latest announcement is KALIA scholarships. The state government, which claims to have already paid 16 lakh farmers, said on Thursday it distributed money to another 14 lakh small and marginal farmers.",0
940,"Opinion |?BJP needs another Modi waveWhat do the most recent state elections tell us about the likely fortunes of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the 2019 national election?The BJP lost the elections in all three of the Hindi belt states that went to the polls in November and December, including two states (Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh) it had controlled for 15 years. This continued a string of weaker-than-expected electoral performances (e.g., Bihar, Gujarat) in states where the BJP had a dominant performance in the 2014 national election.BJP partisans remind us that national elections are very different from state elections and that one should not extrapolate from these results — Modi’s charisma and popularity will loom large in 2019, they argue. Meanwhile, the Opposition sees these results as unmistakeable evidence that the BJP will be greatly weakened in 2019.Political punditry aside, what do state elections really tell us about national elections?It should be clear that state-level voter preferences play a major role even in national elections. Several state-level political parties such as the Trinamool Congress (TMC), the Biju Janata Dal (BJD) or the Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) are likely to win many seats in the Lok Sabha, even though they do not have clearly articulated national agendas. This is a natural consequence of the fact that a party’s capacity to deliver benefits and infrastructure such as roads and schools locally and the strength of the local party organisation are among the most significant determinants of a popularity (even in national elections) — and strong regional parties often perform well on these criteria. At the same time, charismatic leaders such as Indira Gandhi or Narendra Modi, and specific issues or policies like the Ram Janmabhoomi movement or the popularity of the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (NREGS) have helped the BJP or the Congress disproportionately in national elections.In some ways, a party’s performance in Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan is likely to be more predictive of the outcome even in national elections; they also do not have the coalition dynamics of Karnataka or Uttar Pradesh and are largely straight BJP/Congress contests. The BJP won state contests in Chhattisgarh, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh in 2007 and 2008, and also won these states in the 2009 national election, even in the face of a commanding performance by Congress nationally. The BJP won all four states in 2012 and 2013, and swept them in the 2014 national election. Of the 91 parliamentary constituencies (PCs) in these four states, the BJP won an eye-popping 88 seats, a strike rate of 97%. About 31% of all seats the BJP won in 2014 came from just these four states.Data from the Election Commission of India (ECI) allows the analysis of national election results down to state assembly constituency (AC) level.Chart 1 displays the AC-level vote share for the BJP in 2012 and 2013 state elections with the AC-level vote share for the BJP in the 2014 national election. There is clearly strong statistical relationship — state electoral results predict national results. For every 10% increase in AC-level vote share for the BJP in a state election, there is a roughly 5.7% increase in vote share in the 2014 national election. To be sure, the 2014 result was more than a repeat of past state results. It was a wave election, and Narendra Modi had a major effect. In these four states, the BJP had an average vote share of 45% in state elections but an average of 55% in the 2014 national election.This implies a Modi effect — the extra bump to BJP’s vote share in going from state to national elections — of about 10%. This 10% was not distributed uniformly, some areas saw much larger increases than 10% and some areas saw much less.Cut to the present situation. In 2017 and 2018, the average vote share of the BJP in state elections in these four states dropped to 41%. Given the poorer performance in these four states (it retained Gujarat and lost the other three), and the uneven distribution of the Modi effect, how will the BJP perform in 2019?Chart 2 displays the predicted number of seats in these four states in the 2019 national election using a statistical model accounting for the relationship between state and national results and the scale of the Modi effect (and its uneven distribution) — all based on how the 2012 and 2013 state election data predict the 2014 results.If there is a Modi effect at 2014 Modi wave levels, then the BJP can be expected to win about 83 seats in 2019, only five less than in 2014. But if the Modi effect drops to about 5% (that’s still a fairly large effect), then the BJP will only win about 65 out of the 91 seats in these four states.If there is no Modi effect, then the party will win just 37 seats.When combined with a stronger opposition coalition in Uttar Pradesh, the BJP will have a tough time returning to power in such a scenario.The BJP will need to repeat its commanding performance in these four states if it is to win again. No one can really say what will be the electoral impact of the BJP’s announcement of reservations for economically backward classes or the Pulwama attack.But this analysis underscores one simple point. The BJP will have to manufacture another Modi wave if it is to return to power in 2019.",0

See all the photos of JLo and Kareena’s matching looks before you say no.Kareena Kapoor might not have attended the 2019 Oscars. However, photos of the Bollywood actor’s stunning metallic dress from a recent awards function have everyone comparing her sparkly dress to one worn by actor-singer Jennifer Lopez at the 91st Academy Awards in Los Angeles on Monday. JLo might not have been nominated for an Oscar, but she made sure to leave quite the impression on the red carpet, dressed in head-to-toe sparkle, courtesy of fashion designer Tom Ford. For the star-studded occasion, JLo, who also presented an Oscar, teamed her shimmering metallic long-sleeved gown with sleek wavy hair and stunning diamond jewellery. Interestingly, Jennifer Lopez’s Oscars dress looks a lot like Kareena Kapoor’s equally mirrored and sparkling dress by Dubai-based fashion designer, Atelier Zuhra. Take a look JLo and Kareena’s silver dresses that screamed maximalist glamour:While these Jennifer Lopez and Kareena Kapoor dresses bear obvious resemblance to one another — both have mock necks, which elongate their silhouettes — JLo’s shiny floor-length look is (as expected) more red carpet than Kareena’s sleeveless ankle-length dress. JLo’s figure-hugging Tom Ford gown was covered in mosaic mirrored tiles and glistened under the bright lights on the red carpet of Hollywood’s biggest night. Jennifer Lopez added even more shine to her glam by wearing a chunky diamond ring and matching earrings.Kareena Kapoor’s fitted dress, which she wore to the Social Media Summit and Awards 2018 in November, was also decorated with mosaic crystal embellishments, but offered a more fun, party vibe. It featured Atelier Zuhra’s signature shattered mosaic crystal mirrors — inspired by Barcelona’s Gaudí architecture. Another similarity between Kareena and Jennifer’s looks? Their make-up. Both JLo and Kareena wore a dramatic smoky eye to complement their metallic dresses. While, the jury is still out on whether Jennifer Lopez’ Tom Ford gown was inspired by Kareena Kapoor’s Atelier Zuhra design, our guess is not — considering both JLo and Tom Ford don’t need much inspiration to churn out fashion gold (or silver).",0
942,"Pakistan’s house of cards: How its purported aces have been trumpedSome of Pakistan’s purported aces have been trumped by New Delhi over the years, others have been neutralised, and some have outlived their utility. Here are nine cards Pakistan has played against India.By Chidanand RajghattaPakistan has used various “trump” cards over the decades to stalk and stall India’s growth fuelled by being an open, democratic and plural society despite some recent challenges. Some of Pakistan’s purported aces have been trumped by New Delhi over the years, others have been neutralised, and some have outlived their utility. Here are nine cards Pakistan has played against India. The American Card: Used from the time Pakistan was formed when its leaders quickly allied with Washington even as India stumbled into the Soviet orbit. The end of the Cold War, the collapse of the Soviet Union, India’s economic reforms and subsequent growth, the Kargil war, and 9/11 (which had Pakistan’s fingerprints on it) resulted in Pakistan losing this hand. The Afghan Card: Fearful of India’s size and growing heft, Pakistan has long sought “strategic depth” in Afghanistan by installing a friendly, puppet regime in Kabul, a strategy that resulted in the coming to power of Taliban in 1996 (and eventually led to 9/11). But Pakistani overreach built on a Sunni-Wahhabi construct has ruined this card. Except in Taliban pockets, Pakistan is now despised by most Afghans who see it as a malign force. The Kashmir Card: A card the Pakistan military and its elites have played since 1947 to corner resources. Most poor Pakistanis care squat about Kashmir, which is “cash mere” for the Pakistani military as it dips its hand in the till. The Pakistani establishment continues to lie to its own people about UN Resolution (47) on Kashmir (which actually enjoins that Pakistan should first withdraw from the areas it has occupied before other steps). With the passage of time, changes in demographics etc, the resolution, which was non-binding in the first place, is now infructuous. But Pakistan won’t accept it because peace would mean having to whittle down its military budget. The Saudi Card: In this petro dollars-for-nuclear cover deal, the House of Saud has long backed and bankrolled Pakistan, acquiring an outsized influence on its domestic politics to the extent that it is a go-to place for Pakistanis in retirement or exile. But Saudis themselves have embarked on a nuclear quest, and India’s growing influence (it has greater number of workers and white collar workers) means Pakistan’s influence is being reduced down despite Ummah solidarity. As Crown Prince Salman suggested to his hosts last week, when living next to the world’s #3 and #2 economies Pakistan would benefit from peace. The Muslim Ummah Card: Over the years, Pakistan has presented itself as a champion of the Islamic world and has singularly prevented India from acquiring even an observer status in the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), whose associates go beyond the 50-Muslim majority countries in the world (Russia and Thailand for instance have observer status). India, which has the world’s second largest Muslim population after Indonesia, has gradually increased its influence in the the Islamic world (particularly in the Gulf), and a breakthrough is inevitable. But its task will be made difficult if the Hindutva hotheads at home run amuck. The Russia Card: As India has gravitated towards the United States and Pakistan has lost traction in Washington, Islamabad has tried to woo countries such as Russia, Turkey and even Iran in the hope of strengthening its China card. But it is a weak hand. Pakistan is so caught up in domestic radicalisation and internecine bloodletting that few countries have any confidence in its long-term prospects. And despite India’s on-again, off-again ties with these countries, New Delhi interest and influence on account of its economic heft. The China Card (and for China, Pakistan Card): China finds it useful to constrain India using Pakistan. The day India begins to use demographic, economic and cultural clout, the usefulness of this card could diminish. Just think of all the Chinese phones we buy, the general size of the Indian market. China will also not want to import Pakistan’s radicalisation into its sensitive Xinjiang province. The Terrorism Card: Pakistan’s most potent card, an extension of its “death by thousand cut” policy following its defeat in the 1971 war. India’s weaknesses, including in its security doctrine, and global indifference, had enabled Pakistan to export terror (its principal export) and get away, literally, with murder. New Delhi has failed to sensitise world capitals of Pakistani fingerprints on not just terror attacks in India but in many other places across the world. The Nuclear Card: Pakistan’s ultimate trump card that gives cover to its terrorism, one that India failed to take care of between 1971 and 1984 by which time it was too late. The Nuclear Card: Pakistan’s ultimate trump card that gives cover to its terrorism, one that India failed to take care of between 1971 and 1984 by which time it was too late. Remarkably, Pakistan does not have a Pakistan card. The world’s sixth most populous nation has the sixth largest army (and is a nuclear power to boot), but its economy is ranked 24th in size. Maharashtra has a larger economy, and Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Gujarat will each overtake it soon. Nearly Nearly ten times the size of Pakistan’s economy, India is adding one Pakistan to its GDP each year, and will have an economy roughly 40 times larger by 2050. This growing imbalance is actually what makes the Pakistani military reckless in its support of terrorism. New Delhi has only one card – the India card. Playing a cool, calculated, and cohesive hand, while quietly attriting Pakistan, economically and through covert payback, without the hysteria, histrionics and grandstanding currently on display, will yield better results. The Pakistani house of cards will inevitably collapse.",0
943,"Panel wants railway ministry to create body to regulate faresA parliamentary committee wants the railway ministry to create the body it has long promised to, that will, among other things, regulate fares.In its latest report, the Railway Convention Committee of Parliament maintained that since the proposed authority is yet to take a final shape, “consideration of suitable subsidy sharing mechanism is yet to begin.”Parties in power rarely increase passenger fares, irrespective of the carrier’s financial health , given the political ramifications of such a move. The idea to set up an independent body to suggest fare hikes and other reforms was mooted during the United Progressive Alliance’s (UPA) tenure.In April 2017, the NDA government first approved the setting up of the Rail Development Authority (RDA), to make “Pricing of services commensurate with costs, suggest measures for enhancement of Non Fare Revenue, protection of consumer interests, by ensuring quality of service and cost optimization, promoting competition, efficiency and economy”, among other things.The RDA didn’t start functioning and railway ministry officials recently suggested that the creation of the body could take even more time, with parliamentary elections around the corner.The House panel, led by BJD’s Bhartruhari Mahtab, noted that “in view of the fact that the principals of sharing subsidies/ social costs involve reimbursement of such costs to the railways by finance ministry and other departments, the committee stress that the process of establishment of the proposed Railway Regulatory Authority be expedited.”The Parliamentary panel supported the idea of the merger of the rail budget with the general budget—a practice started since 2017—but expressed concern that a decision to demarcate between commercial and social activities of the Indian rail and the reimbursement of the social service obligation has not been done so far.",1
944,"Pepper traders cite Sri Lankan minister statement on illegal imports to IndiaIn a letter to the commerce minister, pepper consortium has raised concerns over spurt in illegal imports of Vietnam pepper.ET Bureau|Feb 12, 2019, 07.57 PM ISTKOCHI: The pepper traders have appealed to the commerce ministry to take steps to raise vigil to prevent the import of pepper from Vietnam through Sri Lanka with origin of certificate from the latter, citing the recent statement by a Sri Lankan minister in media. Kishore Shamji, the coordinator of the Kerala chapter of Indian Pepper and Spice Traders, Growers , Planters Consortium said in a letter to commerce minister Suresh Prabhu that Sri Lankan minister has said that he hasn’t been able to prevent the export of 156 containers of Vietnam pepper to India with certificate of origin from Sri Lanka as it is a racket similar to narcotics trafficking. ``We have been cautioning the Indian government since last week of January that 180 containers of about 1800 to 2000 tonnes of such pepper have left Sri Lankan coast,’’ he said.. This is over and above the pepper smuggled to India from Myanmar, Bangladesh and Nepal, he added The supply of Vietnam pepper is happening by evading duty to the tune of 43% as the duty for import from Vietnam is 51% against 8% for Sri Lanka under India Sri lanka Free Trade Agreement, circumventing the minimum import price of Rs 500 per kg fixed by India for pepper imports. Shamji said the Indian importer pays the minimum import price of Rs 500 ($ 7100 per tonne), for which duty comes to Rs 40 at 8%. Since the Sri Lankan pepper price is $ 3000 per tonne, the balance $4100 is in many cases not remitted. Those who are paying $ 7100 in full gets back the excess money through hawala in cash in Indian rupees. ` In both cases it is a violation of FEMA rules,’’ he alleged. He said such pepper are sold in Indian markets below the domestic price of Rs 350 per kg. Shamji urged the authorities to enforce steps to test for a minimum of 6% piperine content in such imports if it is for extraction purpose. The Vietnam pepper has only 4 to 5 % of piperine, he said.",0
945,"PM-KISAN to provide multiple benefits to farmers: CEAThe average income of farmers in 2015-16 was about Rs 30,000 and, hence, Rs 6,000 would be 20 per cent.PTI|Feb 17, 2019, 12.12 PM ISTNEW DELHI: Farm income support scheme PM-KISAN will provide multiple benefits to farmers, including improving their credit worthiness, said Chief Economic Adviser K V Subramanian. The Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi Yojana (PM-KISAN) was announced in the Interim Budget 2019-20, under which Rs 6,000 will be given in three instalments to 12 crore small and marginal farmers holding cultivable land up to 2 hectare. Producer support in India is very low compared to the other countries and the scheme will help in supplementing that, he told PTI. ""Across countries, producer support for farmers are quite high. The recent OECD study which talks about producers support in India is quite low. ""This section is the one which will be feeding 125 crore mouths and you have a population which is growing at less than 1 per cent and food production is growing at greater than 3 per cent,"" he said. Therefore, Subramanian said, there will be surpluses leading to fall in prices impacting income of farmers. Moreover, he said, the reason farming is supported in a lot of countries is that the risk-return trade-off is bad in the sector. ""Therefore, this constituent required support. There is definitely a case for supporting in a way that does not create distortion,"" he said. The other important benefit of this scheme is in terms of making farmers credit worthy as financial institutions have assured cash flow for this vulnerable section, he said. The average income of farmers in 2015-16 was about Rs 30,000 and, hence, Rs 6,000 would be 20 per cent, Subramanian said. ""If you have assured cash flow, banker can collateralise that and lend to the farmer up to Rs 24,000 in a year. ""Three four times of a Rs 6,000 assured income can be given to farmers by using the microfinance. What is important is that this is an assured return which has not been done so far. This is something financial institutions can indeed use,"" he added. It will have multiple benefits as it starts from basic premise that you need to be supporting an important constituent of economy which is vulnerable, he said, adding that it is something which is important. Prime Minister Narendra Modi will formally launch the scheme at a farmers' rally in Gorakhpur, Uttar Pradesh, on February 24. The data uploaded on the PM-KISAN portal till February 24 will be considered for transfer of the first instalment at the launch event and the second instalment will be given from April 1.",0

949,"Private players allowed only in infrastructure: Rail MinistryThe Railway Ministry on Wednesday said it has so far allowed infrastructure related investments in the rail sector, which is consistent with the government policy.Reacting to reports on private investment in the rail sector, the ministry said investment in container business was only to the extent of ownership of rolling stock and provision of container services as distinct from operation of such trains, which would be carried out by Indian Railways.As per the government's industrial policy, only railway transport is reserved for the public sector. Rail transport is defined as operation of freight and passenger trains and does not include ownership of track, rolling stock and other related infrastructure, the ministry said in a statement.It also said foreign direct investment up to 100 per cent is permitted under the automatic route in railway infrastructure as long as train operations were not involved.",1
950,"Privatisation must cover the whole rail sector, not just the railwaysEvery indicator, not just safety-related ones, underlines the travails of Indian Railways (IR). An instant solution is also offered. Every monopoly is inefficient, especially a public sector one. Liberalise, privatise, corporatise. Isn’t that how railways were developed in India, through private sector initiatives in the 19th century? Let’s leave aside history, where, the private sector didn’t exactly smell of roses. What do we mean by privatisation and what do we mean by IR? There is an IR that owns infrastructure (tracks, signalling, rolling stock, stations) and there is an IR that runs trains. There is also an IR that runs schools and hospitals, but since this is a non-core function, let’s just assume, eventually, IR sheds that. By privatisation, we may either mean private entry, or selling IR’s equity.Most services on trains and stations (cleaning, catering and maintenance) are already privatised. There is little IR does departmentally. Wagons are produced by the private sector. So, increasingly, are coaches and locomotives. What most people mean by private entry is the private sector running trains. On this, will we contemplate locomotive drivers from the private sector and safety (not to be confused with security) handled by the private sector? That’s worth thinking about. On privately run trains, most people don’t know policy already allows that. Why don’t we see them? There have been private luxury trains. On mainstream trains, there are two reasons. First, there has to minor tweaking of legislation to permit the private sector to charge fares and those fares, after the regulator has been set up, have to be reasonable. Second, any train, public or private, requires a path, from point A to point B. Today, capacity constraints are such that it is impossible to provide that path, for both passenger and goods trains. Sure, after freight corridors, capacity constraints will ease a bit. But fundamentally, easing requires huge investments, which IR’s present financial woes don’t allow. If you want to run a private train from Jodhpur to Jaisalmer, I am sure IR will find you a path. However, that’s not a remunerative segment. The private sector will be interested in high-density corridors, where there are capacity issues. Eventually, when private trains take off, they will run in those high density corridors. Who runs trains elsewhere? Will there be something like a universal service obligation? As a final element in private entry, what about stations? Private management of stations is one thing, private development is another. Private development requires a revenue model. Without land for commercial real estate development (like Delhi and Mumbai airports), it won’t work. At best, given distribution of IR land, this might happen for around 15 stations and no more.Let’s turn to privatisation through selling IR’s equity. Everything isn’t like IRCTC, IRCON or IRFC. A major problem is lack of proper commercial accounting in IR. Before buying something, you need to know its worth. Today, this isn’t possible. With successful pilots in zones/divisions already undertaken, there is no reason why the entire IR system shouldn’t have proper commercial accounting in the next two years. After that, production units (for manufacturing rolling stock) can certainly be hived off. There is no convincing market failure argument for these. But on infrastructure interpreted as tracks, signalling and related matters, all railways have a historical evolution and models imported from elsewhere can’t be easily implanted. It is a vertically and horizontally integrated structure, notwithstanding initial independent and regional developments in 19th century. Therefore, unbundling and privatising this is an expensive and pointless proposition. Once you have taken away the infrastructure, in the form of something like an IR Infrastructure Corporation, and hived off production units and non-core functions, what is left in the IR bit that runs trains, especially after private entry? There is nothing left to privatise there.",0
951,"Rabi cereals production to fall by nearly 10%: NBHCThis coupled with the drought in some parts have impacted Rabi sowing and could aggravate the distress in the farm sector.By Jayashree BhosaleAccording to the first estimate of rabi production in 2018-19, National Bulk Handling Corporation (NBHC), rabi cereals production is expected to decline by 9.91%, while chana/gram is the most affected pulse seeing 9.92% fall in acreage. ""As per our study, the total rabi cereals production for the year 2018-19 is expected to be lower by 9.91 per cent to 115.49 Million MT and wheat is expected to show a decline in area by 2.54 per cent to 29.66 Million Ha and production by 4.99 per cent to 94.72 Million MT owing to scanty and inequitable distribution of rainfall in major growing areas,"" an NBHC release said. The northeast monsoon, between October and December, over the country had been “Substantially below Normal”. The cumulative rainfall in the country during the post-monsoon season i.e. 01st October 2018 to 31st December 2018 has been 44 per cent lower than LPA. Rainfall in the four broad geographical divisions of the country during the above period have been lower than LPA by 51 per cent each in Central India & East & North East India, 45 per cent in North West India and 36 per cent in South Peninsula. This coupled with the drought in some parts have impacted Rabi sowing and could aggravate the distress in the farm sector. The southwest monsoon was almost 22 per cent below normal in the Marathwada region of Maharashtra, while in north interior Karnataka, the deficit was almost 29 per cent and 37 per cent below normal in Rayalseema. In Maharashtra, Vidarbha reported 88 per cent post-monsoon rainfall deficiency, which is the highest in the state. Similarly, drought affected regions like Marathwada received 84 per cent less rainfall, followed by central Maharashtra at 64 per cent deficiency and Konkan and Goa at 56 per cent rainfall deficiency in the post-monsoon period. According to NBHC, rabi rice acreage is recorded lower by 14.17 per cent and its production is expected to decrease significantly by 28.91 per cent due to major rice-growing states West Bengal, Odisha, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh are lagging sowing area. Total coarse cereals are expected to fall by 6.9 per cent to 12.1 million MT in 2018-19. This is due to a fall in production of Jowar, maize and barley. Jowar has seen the biggest fall in sowing, with around 2.52 million hectares, a fall of 18.82 per cent over last year. Area sown under maize and barley fell by 5.67 per cent and 2.62 per cent, respectively. NBHC has maintained that the most affected is the cultivation of pulses, particularly gram or chana. The acreage under gram is down in major growing States of Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Karnataka, which is reeling a drought. The gram acreage has decrease by 9.92 per cent to 9.70 million hectares from 10.76 million hectares in last year. Overall, the pulses have shown decrease by 6.75 per cent and the production is expected at 14.48 Million MT despite kulthi acreage and production increase significantly by 29.84 per cent and 31.23 per cent respectively. Masoor production is estimated 1.76 per cent lower at 1.71 Million MT as against 1.74 during 2017-18. ""However, oilseeds are the only crop which managed to retain last year’s level in terms of acreage with less than one per cent increase. A surge in mustard cultivation in Rajasthan has been critical in taking the total oilseeds sowing area to about 8.04 million hectares, which was 0.71 per cent higher than that in 2017-18. Mustard acreage is expected to increase by 5.03 per cent at 7.02 million hectares likewise production is expected to increase by 4.46 per cent to 8.69 million MT. Groundnut, Sunflower and safflower production for 2018-19 has been estimated to be lower at 0.97 million MT.,"" observed NBHC in its estimate.",0
952,"Rail budget to signal road to reform, says minister Suresh PrabhuThe railway budget will signal the direction of long-term reforms needed to revamp the world's fourth-largest rail network, minister Suresh Prabhu said on Thursday. ""The budget will set the direction of long and difficult road of reform,"" Prabhu told state-run broadcaster DD News ahead of his budget presentation.All eyes will be on Prabhu on Thursday on whether he will raise passenger fare and freight rates in his maiden rail budget to boost the cash-crunched railways and include proposals for Make in India initiatives besides enhancing safety and security.Minister of state for railway Manoj Sinha had earlier ruled out a reduction in fares in the context of falling diesel rates but Prabhu is expected to make a tight rope walk as he tries to bridge the huge gap in finances while presenting the budget in Lok Sabha.Prabhu is likely to unravel his grand plans of how to decrease the cross-subsidy for passenger service from freight earnings which is touching Rs 24,000 crore and the steps to increase goods transportation share in the national transporter with or without hiking fares.India's decrepit state-run train services stand to receive at least a 25% boost in investment to over $9 billion, funded solely by falling fuel costs, according to officials familiar with the railway budget.The world's fourth largest rail network could get even more if Prime Minister Narendra Modi makes it a priority, as China did during its rapid economic growth over the past two decades.There are high hopes that his nine-month-old government will plough money into investment in infrastructure needed to haul the economy out of a rut when it presents its first annual federal budget on Saturday.The rail budget could show how far Modi's India is prepared to drive investment in a vital transport sector.""The fall in diesel prices and a pick-up in freight earnings have given us a golden chance to raise investments,"" said one government official.An increase in the budget allocation would go some way to offset disappointment at the lack of private sector interest in investing in railways, after Modi's government last year suggested public-private partnerships for new routes.",1
953,"Rail budget: There’s a lot riding on rail modernisationSuresh Prabhu covered a lot of ground in his railway budget setting out four goals, five drivers and 11 thrust areas for his ministry. First the good news: No new trains or projects were announced, which means that already crowded tracks will not be further burdened and we will see an improved punctuality of passenger and goods trains. The bad news is that he has shied away from hiking passenger fares which remain abysmally low at Rs 0.30 per km, lower than Delhi Metro’s fare of Rs 1 per km.Leading the 11 ‘thrust areas’ is ‘quality of journey’ for the passengers ranging from providing 17,000 bio-toilets in coaches to 650 new toilets at various stations. He has promised e-catering on 108 trains for passengers to get the food of their choice, apps for train bookings, improved access for the disabled, new helplines for women and the facility to purchase a ticket online in five minutes!He also proposed more satellite terminals to reduce overcrowding of existing ones, but has pinned his hopes on the PPP (Public Private Partnership) model which is a highly indeterminate option and could result in turning over Railways’ land to property dealers. Some new innovations include setting up electronic displays at 2000 major stations to show real time status of trains, of course with private participation which would lead to advertising, adding to the cacophony and noise pollution on platforms.Booking tickets 120 days in advance will undoubtedly help citizens to plan in advance, but a higher penalty for last minute cancellation of booking would have also helped to discourage touts who manage to block tickets during the busy festival season.Prabhu has placed great faith in union transport, highways and shipping minister Nitin Gadkari who would help him with providing rail connectivity to ports. For improving rail safety he has drawn heavily on the Anil Kakodkar report proposing the ATP (Automatic Train Protection) system which will be very expensive.Plans are afoot for roping in PSUs to partner the Railways in providing better connectivity to transport their raw material and finished products such as coal, steel and cement. Prabhu has claimed a good preliminary response but how much this will translate into reality remains to be seen.Businesses will welcome proposals for automatic fare rebate for loading wagons on (empty) return journeys. But the results could be mixed since matching consignments with availability of empty wagons will not be easy and could also result in higher wagon turnround affecting operational efficiency.Suresh has promised to build 970 RUBs (Road Under Bridge) and ROBs (Road Over Bridge) to eliminate unmanned level crossings that caused accidents.Setting up a Logistics Corporation will usher in an era of greater involvement by the Railways in multi-modal transport by setting up new facilities at hundreds of disused goods sheds. Undoubtedly partnering with major private logistics providers will be crucial for the success of the scheme.The only redeeming feature of this year’s rail budget is the fact that at last realisation has dawned on the powers that be, that populism has to give way to pragmatism for regaining the financial health of the nation’s economic life line and a crucial engine of growth!The size of the Plan Budget has gone up by 52% from Rs. 65,798 crore in 2014-15 to Rs 1,00,011 crore in 2015-16. Support from the central government constitutes 41.6% of the total Plan budget and internal generation 17.8%, perhaps the best financial indicator to ensure that the Railways will at last be moving on the right track.",1

We have to move merely providing rail infrastructure to other support services such as technology up gradation, better logistic support and better passenger services in an integrated manner,  said  Rajen Gohain, Minister of State for Railways, while inaugurating an ASSOCHAM conference on ‘ASSOCHAM International Summit on Invest Rail .’ “Need of the hour in Indian Railways is the massive investment and new technology without which we cannot move to become a world class transporter. Thus, the plan is to increase investment to nearly one trillion rupees in the next decade”, said Mr Rajen Gohain. Thus, Rail is the right forum for investment that can address nearly all investments challenges such as ensuring reduced global warming, volatile fuel costs, having lower energy consumption, reducing urban congestion, having less land usage, servicing an aging population and making transportation accessible to all ages across all income brackets. In addition, rail has lower infrastructure renewal and maintenance cost which is often mentioned as 20 times lower per ton kilometre that other forms. “Investment in rail will thus help in the planets sustainable and environmental goals and help in meeting the greenhouse gas emission targets. In addition, rail offers a more stable and sustainable form of transportation. We, in Indian Railways, are thus trying to have a collaborative approach in bringing governments, local authorities, railways and other stakeholders on the same wave length for a more sustainable form of transport system”, mentioned Mr. Gohain. Investing in rail stimulates the economy while reducing CO2 emissions and urban congestion. As many countries worldwide plan to step up their investments in rail over the next decade, we in Indian Railways can and must do more. While India has the world’s fourth largest rail network, it has been outstripped by /china, which now has more than six times as much track following an intensive expansion and modernisation of its network over the past two decades. We are thus also looking in using PPP more- or as articulated in the coming years. We aim to keep people at the centre of all our activities and investments in our journey, said Railway Minister. Indian Railways has one of the biggest network in the world and is recognised as one of the largest organisation under single management. It is also an admitted fact that for the past couple of centuries, transportation has fuelled the world’s economy. In this context, for the country’s economic and environmental health, it is thus time to restore the balance between road, air and rail. Others who also spoke during the conference were H.E.

The allies of main political party used to demand the railway ministry to join the government. The party which came to power at Centre also used the railway ministry as a bargaining tool to distribute trophies to its allies. This is a bitter truth,"" he said. ""Leaders from political parties who got the control of the railways were not interested in (development of) railways and I need not say what they were interested in,"" Modi said.The Prime Minister today laid the foundation stone for redevelopment of Gandhinagar railway station, which will get a face-lift at a cost of Rs 250 crore and will have a 300-room five star hotel built atop.""My government has given priority to railways... it should expand, it should be developed, get modernised and it should bring a qualitative change in the lives of common people.”""We have tried to do this in the last two years and five months. We have increased the budget of railways to double of what it was,"" he said.Modi listed various works done by his government to develop railways and said the pace of doubling of railway tracks has increased, besides speeding up of gauge conversion and electrification of lines. He said free WiFi has been provided at railway stations.The Central government is working to increase speed of trains and also striving to bring in global technology to make railways safer, as ""safety is of greatest concern"", Modi said.""In developed countries, 70 per cent goods transportation is carried out by railways while rest by roads. However in India, 15 to 20 per cent is through railways while 70 to 80 per cent is by roads. Goods tend to get costlier when transported by roads. We are stressing on development of freight corridors,"" he said.The Prime Minister also said that railway stations located in cities can be developed by constructing high-rise buildings atop them.Gandhiangar railway station will be redeveloped through a special purpose vehicle (SPV) formed between the Gujarat government and the Indian Railway Stations Development Corporation Ltd (IRSDC). The proposed name of the SPV is Gandhinagar Railway & Development Corporation Ltd.The project includes redevelopment of the railway station as well as the construction of a 300-room five star hotel atop the station. The hotel, with three towers, will be around 65 metres tall.Railway Minister Suresh Prabhu said his ministry is planning to replicate such redevelopment at 23 railway stations across the country.",1
965,"Railways agents misused demonetisation waivers: CAGIn November 2016, 132 Indian Railways’ Jansadharan Ticket Booking Sewaks (JTBS) took unfair advantage of a three-day-long waiver facility provided by the government to allow transactions at railway ticketing counters after the shock demonetisation order of November 8, and deposited unusually big quantities of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 currency notes on the three subsequent days, a CAG report has found out.The 132 JTBS were from the Central, Eastern, Northeast Frontier, North Eastern, North Western and Western Railway (CR, ER, NFR, NER, NWR and WR) zones. On November 9, 2016, the Railway Board, had issued a directive that the Rs500 and Rs 1,000 bank notes would not cease to be legal tender from November 9, 2016 until November 11, 2016, to the extent of transactions at railway ticketing counters for purchase of tickets, for which complete records were required to be maintained.The CAG report said: “Audit test checked the transactions carried out by 132 JTBSs during 07 November 2016 to 11 November 2016 on 59 stations of six Zonal Railways. A comparison of deposits made by the JTBSs for five days of pre and post demonetisation revealed that post demonetization, total cash deposited by these 132 JTBSs exceeded their normal pre-demonetization cash deposit by significant amounts…”The national auditor observed — “No specific directives/instructions were issued by the Railway Board in respect of cash deposited by the JTBSs in Railway’s Deposit Accounts essential for issue/sale of unreserved tickets through computerised Unreserved Ticketing System. 132 JTBS in six Zonal Railways took undue advantage of the facility provided by the Government of India to allow transactions at railway ticketing counters and deposited specified bank notes with the Railways post demonetisation instead of depositing the cash in the banks”.Started in 2008 in order to cut down long queues at railway stations, the JTBS scheme permits an individual to sell railway tickets outside railway stations. The JTBS charges Rs 1 per ticket but can sell only unreserved tickets and cannot issue concession tickets. ",1
966,"Railways begin work on export policyIndian Railways is working on an export policy under which top officials from the country’s coach factories will be able to visit other countries to seek bulk orders for train coaches. The absence of an export policy has impeded the ability of state-run factories to seek regular overseas orders, after executing the last order for coaches, from Sri Lanka, in 2010-12.The railways is looking at Southeast Asia, the Middle East and Africa for potential customers under the proposed policy, seeking alternative sources of revenue by capitalising on the cost advantage offered by its coach factories, which build train cars up to a fifth cheaper than overseas competitors. The policy will empower officials of the rank of general managers and above to take decisions and sew up deals quickly.“Manufacturing coaches is one part where we have good capacity and we can maintain international standards as well. Also, the cost per coach will be 20-25% less than what is there in other parts of the world. If a policy is in place, we will be able to take frequent orders and our officials won’t have to take approval for every decision. They will be free to take decisions,” said Rajesh Aggarwal, member (rolling stock) of the Railway Board.Aggarwal said that even to travel abroad, an official now needs to seek approval from the railway ministry and Railway Board.“We have been doing exports through RITES, but with export policies, we will be able to take direct orders,” Railway board chairman Ashwani Lohani said. RITES is a state-run consulting company that specialises in transport infrastructure.Railways recently exported the first set of Diesel Electric Multiple Units to Sri Lanka from Integral Coach Factory (ICF) in Chennai. ICF has exported coaches and coach components to various countries like Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan, Vietnam, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Tanzania, Mozambique, Angola, Nigeria and Uganda.“ICF is expecting another order from Sri Lanka railways for export of 160 coaches and the modalities are being worked out along with RITES Ltd. Advanced levels of negotiations are going on between Indian Railways and Bangladesh Railways for export of coaches from ICF,” said S Mani, general manager of ICF.Railway is prepared to manufacture both standard and meter gauge coaches and Modern Coach Factory at Raebareli in Uttar Pradesh is being expanded to increase capacity.“The capacity of coach factory in Indian Railway is good and underdeveloped countries can be a good market for India. But quality should be maintained in order to get good revenue,” said RK Singh, former chairman of the Railway Board.",1

969,"Railways Minister flying high on taxpayers moneyUnion Ministers are busy people, and perennially unsure of their schedule. Or so it would seem from the considerable bill run up by the Union Railways Minister on charter planes and multiple bookings.As part of a series on the misuse of public funds by various ministries of the government of India, an investigation into the workings of the Railways Ministry reveals that rail officials frequently have bent rules to provide charter planes to Union Railways Minister Piyush Goyal since he got the portfolio in September 2017. This has cost the public exchequer 15-20 times more than what it would have cost for the minister to board regular planes.A Railways rule underlines that the Railways can hire a charter plane or helicopter only in case of railway accidents. A minister cannot hire a charter plane for official business unless he is inspecting an accident site.It is also worth noting that Narendra Modi had invoked austerity measures soon after his swearing-in as Prime Minister in 2014. The rulebook states that all government officials including ministers have to fly Air India unless flights are not available in emergency situations. However, Railways officials let Piyush Goyal and his two junior ministers in the Railways, take private airlines instead of Air India.In addition to this, the Minister’s office buys two to three air tickets for the same destination on a given day just to ensure that Goyal doesn’t miss his flight. This expense is paid by the Railways, so essentially it is at the expense of Indian taxpayers.In September 2017, within days of swearing-in as Union Railways Minister, Piyush Goyal’s office put out a request for hiring a charter plane to travel from Delhi to Surat and later Mumbai. In response to the request for hiring a charter plane, Additional General Manager, Northern Railways Manju Gupta wrote to the Railways Board: “The Schedule of Powers, vide para 58 of Part-A (Powers of General Manager), empowers the GM/DRMs to requisition helicopter/aeroplane to reach the site of serious accident for rescue operations expeditiously and to evacuate injured and dead in the event of serious accident. No such powers for hiring/booking chartered flight/helicopter for Hon’ble MR (Minister of Railway) have been given therein.’’Newslaundry has accessed this letter. The letter also states that the Railways Board should put appropriate norms in place since “such demands [for charter flights] may arise’’ in future. The letter proposes that the Railways Board should depute a Railways Public Sector Unit (PSU) to hire charter planes if need be. After receiving the letter, the Railways Board without wasting any time appointed Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation (IRCTC) to hire charter planes for the Minister.Goyal, however, later dropped his Surat travel plan. It is unclear how the Railways Board could appoint the IRCTC to overrule a central government circular. Later, as per Railways records accessed by Newslaundry, IRCTC did book charter planes for Piyush on at least three occasions.Records show that Goyal first flew along with his wife Seema Goyal and his private secretary to Mumbai-Belgaum-Delhi on a three-day trip (February 9-11, 2018), which cost Rs 13 lakh. His second charter flight to Shani Shingnapur-Shirdi-Tulapur (pilgrimage places known for their temples) and later to Latur on April 2 cost Rs 25.50 lakh. This trip coincided with a bhoomi poojan of a coach factory he attended at Latur. And on June 2, he travelled from Delhi to Jodhpur and then back to Delhi on a charter plane, costing over Rs 10 lakh.Goyal’s charter plane seems to have incurred more expenses towards waiting rather than flying if one is to go by the three-day Belgaum schedule put out by his office. A charter plane takes anything between Rs 2 lakh and Rs 3 lakh per hour as waiting charge.According to the schedule, he arrived at Belgaum at 10:00 am on February 10. The charter plane remained parked till 8.15 pm on February 11, and then it took off to Delhi, his final destination. And when the plane was parked, the minister travelled by road to inspect a site of road over-bridge, paid tribute to Mahatma Gandhi at Belagavi railway station, inaugurated UTS Mobile ticketing App over South Western Railways Zone from Belagavi railway station and works to the facelift of the station building.Piyush Goyal also interacted with industrialists and members of Chamber of Commerce. The function went on for an hour to get members’ views on the forthcoming annual budget and Railways infrastructure.It would have cost Goyal less than Rs 50,000 if he had taken a routine return flight to Belgaum, assuming he was travelling by business class. But a charter plane cost taxpayers nearly Rs 13 lakh. The minister inaugurated a Railways App and discussed the budget with businessmen. Again, it should be remembered that the minister is not entitled to charter planes unless he is inspecting an accident site.During his charter flight to Latur in April, Goyal first went to pay homage to deities. “I’m fortunate to have darshan of Shani mandir in Shani Shingnapur this morning; I took blessings of Sai Baba at Shirdi and then went to Tuljapur to take blessings of Maa Bhawani before coming to Latur,’’ he was later quoted saying in his speech. Piyush did bhoomi pujan of a coach factory at Latur and wound up the tour. The chartered flight alone cost the exchequer Rs 25.50 lakh.Piyush and his family visited Shani Shingnapur in the past too. According to his website, he had visited Shani Shingnapur on October 26, 2016, along with his wife and son Dhruv.Moreover, one of his latest trips by a special plane was to Jodhpur, where he flagged off Humsafar Jodhpur-Bandra Express. This cost taxpayers a little over Rs 10 lakh.",1

972,"Railways, Urban Development Ministries To Redevelop Stations Under Smart City PlansIn a major initiative, railway stations and adjoining areas will be redeveloped on Smart City lines for enhancing passenger amenities, easy access to stations, enabling optimal utilization of land at railway stations, as a part of Smart City development. A Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was signed in this regard by the Ministries of Urban Development and Railways in the presence of Shri M.Venkaiah Naidu and Shri Suresh Prabhu. Dr.Sameer Sharma, Mission Director, Smart City Mission and Shri Rajiv Chaudhary, Advisor, Ministry of Railways signed the MoU. Both the Ministers lauded the joint initiative as a historic landmark that brings synergy in development of smart cities since there can’t be a smart city without a smart railway station. M.Venkaiah Naidu said on the occasion that this convergence based city development will result in qualitative improvement in city life. He suggested involvement of local people in redevelopment plans. Naidu suggested that to begin with 10 cities could be taken up for the proposed redevelopment with the involvement of National Buildings Construction Corporation(NBCC) which has successfully executed redevelopment projects on self-financing basis. These cities are : Sarai Rohilla (Delhi), Bhubaneswwar, Lucknow, Varnasi, Jaipur, Kota, Thane, Margao(Goa), Tirupati and Puducherry. This was agreed to by Railway Minister. Minister of Railways Suresh Prabhu said that railway stations have been the core of city development and have become congested over time and their redevelopment offers immense opportunities for changing city landscape. Stating that redevelopment work of Habibganj railway station has already been awarded and plans for Anand Vihar (Delhi), Surat, Bijwasan and Gandhinagar are in advanced stage. He said that several countries like Germany, France, Japan, South Korea, UK and Belgium have showed interest in redevelopment and a Round Table of domestic and overseas bankers will be organized next week to discuss financing of these redevelopment projects. To be implemented first in the 100 cities included in the Smart City Mission, redevelopment of railway stations will be undertaken in AMRUT (Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation) and HRIDAY (Heritage Infrastructure Development and Augmentation Yojana) cities extending the scope of the MoU to over 500 cities. Railway station and the adjoining area in each of these cities will be redeveloped on the lines of Area Based Development provided in the Smart City Mission Guidelines. Average cost of redevelopment of identified area of about 500 acres in the Smart City Plans of 60 cities approved so far comes to about Rs.1,500 cr. The proposed redevelopment involving railway stations envisages improving passenger amenities, easy access to stations, integrated public transport hub, waiting halls and other amenities for passengers, development of residential and commercial spaces, land scaping etc. The joint initiative of the Ministries of Urban Development and Railways widens the smart city development to one more area in each of the mission cities with each city required to select one area under respective Smart City Plans in the first phase. The MoU proposes two Joint Venture options for speedy redevelopment of railway station centred areas. The first being between the Railways and the Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) formed for execution of Smart City Plans, with equal share in equity. In the second model, National Buildings Construction Corporation (NBCC) can be roped in with equal share among the three. NBCC can design, develop and execute the redevelopment plans on self-financing basis. While the Ministry of Railways takes the responsibility of forming Joint Ventures, the Ministry of Urban Development will work with the States and Urban Local Bodies for integrating railway station redevelopment as part of smart city development plans. MoU states that ‘Both railway station redevelopment and Smart City concepts are part of holistic development of respective city. Redevelopment of railway station and its suburbs as part of Smart City Plans leads to an integrated public transport hub around railway station and encourage Transit Oriented Development.” The validity of the MoU is five years to begin with and can be extended with the consent of both the Ministries. Smart City Plans of some cities have already included area based development surrounding railway stations. These include; Bhubaneswar, Thane and Solapur (Maharashtra), Kakinada (Andhra Pradesh), Ahmedabad, Ajmer, Hubli-Dharwad (Karnataka). Smart City Plans of some other cities may potentially impact city railway station and allied services. These include; Jaipur, Kochi, Jabalpur, Visakhapatnam, Indore, Pune, Bhopal, Chennai etc.",0

Of the 54 consequential train accidents in 2017 (between April 1 and December 15), five were reported from ECR.Rescue and relief works in progress after the nine coaches of Delhi-bound Seemanchal Express derailed at Sahadai Buzurg station in Vaishali district, Hajipur on February 3.(PTI Photo)East Central Zone of the Indian Railways, where 11 coaches of the Seemanchal Express (Jogbani-Anand Vihar) derailed on Sunday, is notorious for accidents.In a safety review in December, it emerged as the second-worst zone (of the total 18) in terms of consequential train accidents followed by the Northern Railway. It recorded five such incidents between April 1, 2018 and December 15, 2018. Northern Railway reported eight such incidents during the period. The total number stood at 45.The Indian Railways has adopted a “Zero Accident” policy, and the number of passengers killed in various railway accidents was lowest in 2017-18 (57). But deaths caused by derailments make experts worried. The Railways categorises accidents the following categories: collision, derailment, mishaps at manned level crossings, mishaps at unmanned level crossings and fire.“Bulk of railways’ money goes to staff cost and fuel...there is little left for the maintenance. Derailment of a passenger train is a major embarrassment for the railways, and they must do track maintenance on priority. The zone where the accident has taken used to be called the sleeping division, as efforts to improve tracks were less. This accident is a symptom that tracks and coaching maintenance are faulty and need to be fixed,” said Sri Prakash, who retired as member (traffic) of the Indian Railways in 2009.The East Central Railway comprises Dhanbad, Mughal Sarai, Samastipur and Danapur divisions.

But the main rabi crop of wheat may have scraped through the inclement weather. While the rains will help cut the cost of irrigationNSE -1.73 % for the wheat crop, these are set to affect the output of oilseeds. “Mustard is affected by heavy rains as well as strong gust in several district ,” a senior official at the Haryana agriculture department said. Growers of peas, potato and cauliflower have suffered heavy losses as their crops are affected by the hailstorm. While mustard has taken a hit in Haryana, the weather has damaged the potato crop in Punjab. Wheat is expected to gain from the precipitation, though there could be a marginal yield loss in hailstorm-affected areas. As the wheat crop has not attained height, the wind and rain have not affected it,” an official of Punjab’s agriculture department said, adding: “But hailstorm has affected all the crops.” Officials, however, have alerted farmers about the risk of yellow rust that dwells in wet weather. Hailstorm and strong winds have caused damage in several pockets in districts of Sirsa, Hisar, Mahendergarh, Palwal, Bhiwani Kaithal and Gurgaon in Haryana. The Haryana government has decided to conduct survey of damage to crops In Punjab, initial reports indicate crop losses in Patiala, Ludhiana, Fatehgarh Sahib, Hoshiarpur, Mohali and Ferozepur. “There are preliminary reports of damage to crops, mainly perishables, but it will take a few days for the assessment of the extent of loss,” Punjab’s principal secretary of agriculture, KS Pannu, said.

978,"Rice Exports to gather steam on US, West Asia demand boostRice exports from India are set to swing in the last quarter of this year on a spate in orders after shipments slumped 14% in the last three quarters over high input costs and tepid demand from Bangladesh.By Parshant KrarChandigarh: Rice exports from India are set to swing in the last quarter of this year on a spate in orders after shipments slumped 14% in the last three quarters over high input costs and tepid demand from Bangladesh. “Consignments in January are better than the previous year and the trade is likely to attain levels close to the previous year,” a senior commerce and industry ministry official told ET. Exporters have seen a surge in demand from the United Arab Emirates, Iran, Saudi Arabia and the US this quarter. The official said the supply for exports has streamlined after being affected for the last few months of 2018 because of assembly polls in some states. A bumper yield in Bangladesh also took toll on Indian exports, he said. The 5% subsidy on export value extended to non-basmati rice under the Merchandise Exports from India Scheme (MEIS) in November helped in recovery of trade , but margins remained thin, exporters said. “Raw material (paddy) prices are still high as most farmers are inclined to sell to the state agencies in states, including Chhattisgarh,” said P Baskara Reddy, promoter of Kakinada-based Sri Chitra Agri Exports. He said the exporters hope that the scheme will be extended beyond March 26 and the incentive doubled to 10% under MEIS to complement the shrinking margins. The announcement of higher price assistance by political parties just ahead of the harvesting season in the run-up to the assembly polls had spiked government procurement and dampened private purchase in states like Chhattisgarh where the procurement price was higher by 60%. The non-basmati rice exports that are dependent largely on varieties grown in Chhattisgarh were affected as paddy supply dried up following announcement of higher than minimum support price (MSP). Exporters are wary of such politically motivated price assistance. “Higher procurement price will subdue trade in the coming years. Direct financial assistance is a better route to support farmers,” Rice Exporters’ Association president BV Krishan Rao said. Higher procurement would lead to a surplus buffer stock and a situation where the government will have to auction its stocks at a loss, he said. “Similar situation took place in 1999-2000 when Food Corporation of India had to release its brimming stocks at a discount after higher MSP had boosted federal procurement three-times over the buffer stock norms,” Rao said. The rice procurement crossed 41 lakh tonnes so far compared to 32.5 lakh tonnes in Chhattisgarh in the last Kharif marketing season. “We have not taken export commitments this season as farmers are keen to sell to government agencies,” a senior executive of Uttar Pradesh-based Laxmi Rice Mills said. While export of basmati rice has increased till December, non-basmati exports stayed downhill with 5.6 million tonnes of shipment till December as against 6.3 MT a year ago.",0
979,"Safety gear failed in Mirage crash that killed both pilotsThe reason for the crash itself remain unknown for the black box of the Mirage fighter jet has been sent to France for analysis, but the death of the pilots could have been averted if the barriers, meant to stop the aircraft, had held, an official said.Smoke and fire billow after an Indian Air Force's Mirage 2000 trainer aircraft crashed in the southern city of Bengaluru on February 1.(ANI Photo)The deaths of two Indian Air Force (IAF) test pilots in a Mirage 2000 crash at the Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd (HAL) airport in Bengaluru last week may have been caused in part by arrester barriers, critical airfield safety equipment, giving way, officials with first-hand information of the matter said on condition of anonymity.The reason for the crash itself remain unknown — the black box of the fighter has been sent to France for analysis — but the death of the pilots could have been averted if the barriers, meant to stop the aircraft, had held, one of the officials added.“Once the arresters gave way, there was little chance that the two had of bringing the aircraft to rest,” he said. The two pilots, Squadron Leader Samir Abrol and Squadron Leader Siddhartha Negi, died on the spot.The arresters installed at HAL airport are expected to stop aircraft that weigh up to 30 tonnes travelling at speeds of up to 160-170 knots. The Mirage 2000 trainer weighs much less, 13-14 tonnes, and was travelling at a speed of less than 160 knots, the officials added.Abrol and Negi were on an “acceptance sortie” of the Mirage 2000 trainer aircraft after it was overhauled by the Bengaluru-based, state-owned company. The sortie was taking place on the HAL runway in Yemalur in Bengaluru on February 1.An HAL spokesperson declined comment. An Indian Air Force (IAF) spokesperson, too, declined comment because of the ongoing court of inquiry into the accident.Read more| ‘My son loved to fly Mirage 2000’, says father of IAF officer killed in crash in BengaluruThe accident occurred a day after IAF chief Air Chief Marshal BS Dhanoa criticised HAL, and also pointed to the number of pilots who lost their lives testing the state-owned firm’s indigenously developed aircraft.According to the officials, the number of times major snags have been detected by IAF at the time of delivery in an aircraft overhauled or manufactured by HAL is high. For instance, last June, an Su-30 was on an acceptance sortie (its 13th) when it crashed near Nashik. The pilot and the flight engineer ejected successfully. These sorties are done by IAF only after HAL has flown the aircraft a certain number of times and cleared them for acceptance.In 2018-2019, the Russian designed Su-30Mki – the mainstay fighter of the IAF – manufactured by HAL required as many as six sorties as against the designated two sorties before they could be accepted. “The increased number of sorties is because snags were found,” a second senior government official said.Read more | Outdated jets for IAF, cheese & wine for babus: Pilot’s brother pens poemSimilarly, Mirage 2000 aircraft overhauled by HAL have, on average, required two sorties more than the mandatory number because of snags. And, Jaguars, the British made deep-strike bombers that are overhauled by HAL, have required, on average, three sorties more than the two sorties designated for acceptance. For the advanced light helicopters (ALH), flown by the Indian Army, Navy and Air Force, and also made by HAL, the numbers are equally bad.“Every aircraft needs to go through a certain number of sorties testing various test points before it can be accepted by IAF for deployment. The fact that the more sorties are having to be flown to rectify the snags indicates either the process of testing is not being done properly by the manufacturer or the process lacks rigorousness at the HAL end,” said Air Marshal SBP Sinha (retd), who till recently was the Air Officer Commanding at the Central Air Command of IAF.Arrester barriers are installed at the end of the runway to deal with exactly the kind of situation the overhauled Mirage 2000 trainer was facing. They are meant to stop an aircraft that has either aborted take-off or made an emergency landing from overshooting the runway with minimal damage to aircraft or injury to the crew.In this case, the Mirage 2000 trainer came down seconds after take-off. The undercarriage of the aircraft was sheared off, most likely because of the impact. And the arrester barrier was the only way that the two test pilots could have brought the aircraft to a stop.The black box of the fighter has been sent to France for a detailed analysis to assist the Court of Inquiry (CoI) that is investigating the crash. “Separately, inquiries are also being conducted on why the arrester barrier gave way,” said a senior HAL official who asked not to be named.",0

981,"Scrap free pass for rail employees’Railway activists on Sunday demanded that perks like free suburban passes for railway employees as well as their families be taken away from both Central and Western railway employees, to save more time and money.They were reacting to the Central Railway’s proposal of limiting the validity of return tickets to six hours. Subhash Gupta from Rail Pravasi Sangh and also a member of CR’s Divisional Railway Users Consultative Committee (DRUCC) said, “Officials said that the idea was proposed to save time and, on the other hand, the railway employees are issued passes that can be used for unlimited number of journeys for free.”A railway official revealed on the condition of anonymity that around 3.5 lakh railway employees and family members avail of this facility in Central Railway’s (CR) head office at CST and Western Railway’s (WR) at Mumbai Central.“The railway passes is resulting in a loss of approximately Rs 7 to Rs 7.5 crore yearly as a result of this facility to its employees,” said the official.The passes include both second and first class but most of the passes get issued for first class,” he further added.Mr Gupta said the railway city officials should discuss the proposal and the passes with the unions.“It is in common knowledge that free passes are not given to not only to the employees but also to the immediate family and it is a burden that the Mumbai railway can no longer bear” he said.“The railway employees should at least get together with the union and discuss the issue,” he further added.",1
982,"Send a message: Pakistan’s weakest pressure points are financial rather than militaryIndia can work with the US, EU and other major powers to impose tough sanctions on Pakistan’s military-ISI elite which drives its security policies and much else in the country.TNN|Feb 25, 2019, 11.16 AM ISTFollowing the Pulwama terror attack Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan claimed he needed “actionable intelligence” on Jaish-e-Muhammed’s (JeM) role, despite the terror outfit itself claiming responsibility for the attack. Since then, the Pakistani Punjab government has moved to take control of the seminaries in Bahawalpur, thought to be JeM’s headquarters. But information minister Fawad Chaudhry claiming these are purely religious madrasas, with no connection to JeM, showed Islamabad up to its usual game of making token gestures whenever international heat is cranked up on it. It does indicate an area of vulnerability, though, which is worth building upon if New Delhi is to inflict a high cost on Pakistan for harbouring terror safe havens. Military strikes are difficult at this point since the element of surprise is gone; moreover terror facilities such as Bahawalpur are likely to have been evacuated by now. But Pakistan is short of foreign currency; indeed its policy of nurturing terror creates chronic internal instability which prevents it from having a viable usual game of making token gestures whenever international heat is cranked up on it. Giving proof to Pakistan on terror activities from its soil has been proven to be pointless by now, but lobbying international agencies has had some success. The UN Security Council has, for the first time, condemned a terror strike in Kashmir and blamed JeM for it. New Delhi must strongly lobby international financial agencies such as IMF or FATF to blacklist Pakistan and deny it financial bailouts, till such time as it can roll up its terror infrastructure. This also serves US interests, as it can roll up its terror infrastructure. This also serves US interests, as it would like to see a stable Afghanistan when it leaves. New Delhi and Washington should work closely together on this. India can, in addition, work with the US, EU and other major powers to impose tough sanctions on Pakistan’s military-ISI elite which drives its security policies and much else in the country. Such sanctions would quickly bring Pakistan around, and the argument for them can be reinforced by putting the international community on notice that further terror outrages such as 26/11 or Pulwama will lead to an automatic military response from India, as India has the right to defend itself and domestic public opinion will not stand for anything less.",0

All the seven persons — four men, two women and an eight-year-old girl — died on the spot. Six of the deceased were in the ambulance while one was travelling in the car, police said.“The ambulance was going from Jammu to Patna and carrying the body of one Zakir Ansari. The driver, Hari Singh from Jammu, was killed in the accident,” said SP Sharma, in-charge of Baldeo police station in Mathura.Police have been able to identify five of the deceased. These included Jehangir Alam 36, Mohd Tahir Ansari, 32, Suhail Ahmad, 30, and ambulance driver Hari Singh, police said.“Those in the car on the other side of divider were from Tundla town in Firozabad.

984,"Smriti Irani in Amethi ahead of PM’s visit, accuses Rahul Gandhi of lyingAhead of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to Amethi on March 3, union textile minister Smriti Irani on Sunday reached the Congress bastion to launch a scathing attack on local MP and Congress president Rahul Gandhi.Her Amethi visit was timed with the launch of the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN) Scheme by the PM in Gorakhpur on Sunday.Distributing Kisan Samman Nidhi certificates to 25 farmers from Amethi in a symbolic launch of cash transfer scheme during a programme at Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya in Gauriganj, Irani repeatedly accused Gandhi of “lying”.Hailing the PM-KISAN Scheme, she said it would benefit 3.80 lakh farmers of Amethi alone. Modi had last visited Amethi on the final day of the 2014 Lok Sabha poll campaign, a visit which political experts believe helped Irani put up an impressive fight against Gandhi in just about 20 days.She had brought down Gandhi’s victory margin to one lakh votes in 2014, down from 3 lakh in 2009. Irani is widely tipped to re-contest against Congress chief Rahul Gandhi in the 2019 LS polls.“Five years back, Narendra Modiji had promised development. He has honoured his promise even as Amethi’s ‘naamdaar’ family only sold dreams to you,” she said after listening to Modi’s radio show ‘Mann ki Baat’.Accusing Gandhi of never raising the issue of “Amethi’s development” in Lok Sabha, she said: “Your local MP never cared about the development of Amethi but about 1.40 lakh people in Amethi benefited through Modi government’s Ujjawala scheme and another 1.25 lakh got the benefits of Ayushman Bharat Scheme which provides illness cover of up to Rs 5 lakh per annum to each poor household.”“The Modi government gave you ‘izzat ghar’ (toilets). In record time, the Yogi Adityanath government in UP has identified poor farmers who would benefit under the Kisan Samman Nidhi,” she said, stressing that only the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) could develop Amethi.She said the Modi government honoured 12 farmers with Padma awards.Irani inspected the venue where the PM would address the people of Amethi and also met BJP leaders who have been tasked with ensuring a good turnout for Modi’s rally.Both the Samajwadi Party (SP) and the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) have decided against fielding a candidate from Amethi and Rae Bareli in 2019 LS polls – a decision likely to benefit the Congress.",0

986,"Spontaneous rail roko hits Central RailwayA technical snag at the level crossing at Bhivpuri railway station triggered commuter unrest at Badlapur Friday early morning.Hundreds of angry commuters gathered on platforms and railway tracks to stage a “rail roko” for nearly six hours, from 5.05 am till such time the protest was called off after a written assurance from the stationmaster. Meanwhile, Amitabh Ojha, divisional railway manager (DRM), held commuters responsible and said he would find out the anti-social elements responsible for fanning the agitation. A CST-bound local got delayed owing to signal failure at Bhivpuri which sparked off the protest. What started as an argument between commuters and the stationmaster turned into a full-blown rail roko. “At first, there were only four railway police present at the station but when commuters stepped in front of the train to stop it and did not budge for half-an-hour, we deployed around 160 personnel on an emergency basis. We were afraid it would escalate into a Diva-like situation,” said an official on condition of anonymity. Initially, a handful of commuters started protesting irregular rail services on Central Railway (CR) but soon, hundreds of commuters, who face the same plight every day, joined in.Passengers stopped all trains plying into and out of the station and shouted slogans against CR. They were in no mood to listen to the railway police or commuters’ association or pravasi sanghatana. Finally, railway minister Suresh Prabhu had to intervene and request commuters to end their agitation.Following Mr Prabhu’s tweet, Mr Ojha reached Badlapur around 10 am and held a meeting with railway officials and the railway police. City police too attended the meeting. The police then tried to get commuters off the railway tracks but in vain. At about 10.40 am, the stationmaster assured commuters that local trains would run on time and would not be delayed. He urged them to stop agitating and allow trains to move.Only after a written assurance from him did commuters call off the protest, and the first train of the day which had been stopped at Badlapur since 5.05 am, started its journey at 10.52 am.By end of the day, CR saw more than 50 services cancelled and more than 65 trains delayed. ""We are expecting even bigger numbers by end of the day. The Kalyan-Thane section had no trains, and we began to run special trains between Ambernath and CSTM/Kalyan, Vangani and Karjat, and Khopoli,"" said another official on condition of anonymity.After train services resumed, Mr Ojha, while speaking with media persons, said that some anti-social elements were behind the protest. ""We are trying to find the people who started the protest at the railway station early morning. We suspect they were not regular commuters but probably some anti-social elements and we will trace them,"" he said. However, no complaint against unknown persons was filed with the railway police till evening.Advocate R.S. Godbole, adviser to pravasi sanghatana, said that the population of Badlapur had increased over the past five years as most people from Mumbai had shifted to Badlapur owing to low-cost housing and clean atmosphere. However, CR had not increased its services proportionately.""There's always a heavy rush of Pune-bound commuters. We need a third and fourth dedicated lane for express trains from Kalyan to Karjat. But the railway board has ignored our demands. Friday's incident is nothing but commuters' pent-up anger that finally exploded. If the issues are not sorted out, what happened at Diva could well be repeated at Badlapur,"" warned Advocate Godbole.Meanwhile, with over 21 local train ferries affected since morning and trains running from CST to Ambernath, most commuters travelled to Ambernath by taking an auto-rickshaw from Badlapur station.Sensing an opportunity, rickshaw-wallahs charged passengers Rs 200 instead of the usual Rs 20 for the Badlapur-Ambernath commute. Kalyan Dombivali Municipal Transport provided five city buses for the Kalyan-Badlapur ferry.",1

The announcement comes just ahead of the Lok Sabha poll dates being declared. As part of the agreement, the Railway Board will give 650 acres of its land at Re 1 per acre, and in turn, the Karnataka government will bear partial costs of doubling two lines, estimated to cost Rs 1,700 crore.In a joint press conference alongside Kumaraswamy, Goyal said the long-awaited rail network connecting 82 stations spread over 160 km costing Rs 23,000 crore will be completed in six years.Goyal said, “The ‘19’ conditions subject to which ‘in principle’ approval was given by Karnataka state cabinet will be ratified, as mutually agreed during the meeting today.”The CM also assured, “In next cabinet meeting of Government of Karnataka scheduled to be held on February 25, cabinet resolution will be passed on the same. GO to that extent will be communicated to Ministry of Railways for further taking up the project.”A statement from the Indian Railways further stated, “Minister of Railways agreed for granting railway land for the project at very nominal lease basis of Re.1 per acre, which will reduce the cost of project by about Rs.6700 crores, nearly by 30 %. Government of Karnataka agreed for unequivocal right of FSI ‘5’ on railway land to Indian Railway for financing of project.Government of Karnataka will approve the entire corridor without any curtailment. It is also agreed by Government of Karnataka will do cost sharing of two doubling projects Baiyyappanahalli-Hosur, Yesvantpur-Banaswadi-Hosur which was initially agreed and later disagreed upon by State Government.”As part of this project, the Kempegowda International Airport will also be connected to the city via the suburban rail system. Out of the 83 stations, 12 including Majestic will have intermodal connectivity with the Bengaluru Metro. The announcement comes after days of disagreement between the state and Centre over the cost sharing of the project. The Ministry of Railways had also expressed surprise at Karnataka increasing the length of the rail project to 360 km without prior intimation.The announcement was awaited as the Karnataka Chief Minister gave an in-principal nod to the project based on a  pre-feasibility report readied by the Rail India Technical and Economic Service (RITES) in January.",1

The seer was heading to Haridwar from Prayagraj (Allahabad). The driver is said to have slept while driving the SUV, which crashed into the truck ahead.UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath and BJP president Amit Shah condoled the demise of Hansdevacharya, who was the leader of the Bairagis campaigning for construction of a Ram temple in Ayodhya at the site where Babri Masjid existed.The mosque was demolished in December 1992 by karsevaks (volunteers) who had gathered in the UP town following a call given by Vishwa Hindu Parishad and supported by the Bharatiya Janata Party to push for construction of a Ram temple there. The VHP and the BJP have maintained that it was the place where Lord Ram was born.The Supreme Court is hearing the title suit in the matter after a judgment of the Allahabad High Court was challenged before it.

993,"Tragedies are becoming far too commonThe Indian Air Force can begin addressing the problem by being more transparent and releasing periodic reports on accidents and their causes.A still from a video footage shows an aircraft in flames after two aircrafts of IAF's aerobatic team Surya Kiran crashed near the Yelahanka airbase in Bengaluru, Feb 19, 2019(PTI)During the rehearsal for the Aero India show currently underway, two Hawk Mk 132 aircrafts collided resulting in the death of one pilot. The tragic news comes close on the heels of a Mirage 2000 crash on February 1, which led to loss of two pilots. A Jaguar crashed on January 28 and a Mig-27 crashed on February 12, thankfully without any loss of lives.The problem of crashes is not new for the Indian Air Force (IAF). The year 2018 saw a number of crashes involving Sukhoi, Jaguar and MIG planes. In fact, the number of accidents that IAF has had with MIGs — 482 in 40 years till 2012 — had earned the aircraft the dubious title of “flying coffin”. The infamy was immortalised in the iconic film Rang De Basanti in 2006.Why are IAF planes so accident prone? One, it is simply the problem of slow movement on defence modernisation. IAF is flush with ageing planes on their last legs. Chief Justice of India Ranjan Gogoi recently dismissed a plea asking for judicial enquiry into the February 1 Mirage crash claiming that the aircraft was very old and “bound to crash”.Two, IAF is known to make its pilots undergo intense and rigorous training. Such a practice puts immense strain on the limited number of aircraft, pilots and the support staff. Three, tardy maintenance and upgrade of some of these planes has also been an issue. IAF puts the blame on HAL, which indeed is running way behind the schedule on a number of projects including the Mirage 2000 upgrade.Four, IAF has to operate in harsh tropical weather which is quite demanding on its planes. Then there are problems such as bird strikes, which, some estimates suggest, are responsible for 10% of accidents. It should be noted that the government scrapped a Rs 250 crore tender for buying bird detection and monitoring radars in 2015.Perhaps, IAF can begin addressing the problem by being more transparent. An annual, or even a triennial, report on accidents and their causes would be a good way to start. Some individual cases may be embarrassing to the service, but an aggregate release of data would do much good simply by shining the light on deficiencies — and ensure that more of its brave pilots do not become casualties.",0
994,"Transformation of railways in NDA budgets Prime Minister Narendra Modi had promised to transform the railways before coming to power, and he has been on track. Though there's still a lot to be done, the railways have managed to shed the image of a state enterprise impervious to change and aloof to its customers' needs. A large number of new customer services has made the railways more customer-oriented while launch of faster trains and significant upgrades of existing ones have changed the look of the railways. In Railway Budget 2014, then railway minister Sadananda Gowda pitched for reforms by proposing private and foreign direct investment and public-private partnership to meet the resource crunch. He proposed the highest-ever plan outlay of Rs 65,445 crore. He also announced plans for introduction of a bullet train in Mumbai-Ahmedabad sector. ""We need huge investment for running bullet train. There was a ban on FDI in railways. Now we would request commerce ministry to delete that clause so that thethere can be FDI in infrastructure development,"" he said. At that time, the announcement did not excite many, but the ambitious project did begin within a few years with a loan from Japan. In Railway Budget 2015-16, the new minister Suresh Prabhu kept fares unchanged and eschewed populist gestures such as new trains and stations in his maiden budget, He preferring to bring a technocrat's focus to try and improve amenities for customers, set the organisation's trajectory for the next five years and put its derailed finances back on tracks. In a historic move, the government merged the railway budget with the general budget in 2017, ending a 92-year-old practice of a separate budget for the country’s largest transporter. The total proposed outlay for 2017-18 was Rs 1,31,000 crore, an 8 per cent increase from the 2016-17 budget. Finance Minister Arun Jaitley announced that a Rail Safety Fund will be created over a period of five years with a corpus of Rs 100,000 crore. He also announced that 500 stations would be made differentlyabled-friendly by providing lifts and escalators. He promised a new Metro Rail Policy with focus on innovative models of implementation and financing, and standardisation and indigenisation of hardware and software. Budget 2018-19 gave a big boost to railways with a capital expenditure of Rs 1.48 lakh crore. ""Most of this money will be spent on capacity expansion, since it is a priority for the national transporter,"" Jaitley said. He proposed a target of doubling 18,000 km of lines and said gauge conversion was underway to eliminate capacity constraints. The minister said 36,000 km of rail track renewal had been targeted in the coming year while 4,267 unmanned railway crossings on broad gauge routes were to be eliminated in the next two years ",1
995,"Trauma care key to cut accident deathsDelhi reported the highest number of fatal road crashes during 2017 with 1,584 deaths, according to the latest available data from the ministry of road transport and highways. In the same year, 6,673 accidents were reported from the city.The AIIMS trauma centre, one of the two level 1 trauma centres in Delhi, receives around 200 to 250 cases daily, the highest in the city. Of these, over 70% are victims of road crash.(Picture for representation)Delhi reported the highest number of fatal road crashes during 2017 with 1,584 deaths, according to the latest available data from the ministry of road transport and highways. In the same year, 6,673 accidents were reported from the city.“The number of traffic deaths in Delhi is high because of the high number of road accidents. And, the infrastructure and the enforcement of traffic rules, along with the pre-hospital care systems, are to blame,” said Dr Sanjeev Bhoi, professor of emergency medicine at Jai Prakash Narayan Apex Trauma Centre, All India Institute of Medical Sciences.The AIIMS trauma centre, one of the two level 1 trauma centres in Delhi, receives around 200 to 250 cases daily, the highest in the city. Of these, over 70% are victims of road crash.And, the numbers might be under-reported.“These numbers are gathered from the police cases registered and are likely to be under-reported. Sometimes patients die days after the case is registered and this may not get updated in the records,” said Dr Rakhi Dandona, who heads the Global Burden of Disease –Road Injuries group for the State-level Disease Burden initiative.At country level, the World Health Organisation’s Global Status Report on Road Safety 2018 estimated the number of traffic deaths to be 2,99,091 in 2016, which is nearly double the 1,50, 785 deaths reported in that year.Injuries to be wary ofMost accident victims suffer from poly-trauma — injuries to more than one system of the body. But it is the head injury that leads to the highest mortality and disability.“Of all the accident cases, almost 40% come in with severe head injuries. And, in such cases, even if the patient reaches hospital on time and receives the best care, 35% die within 48 hours.Of those that survive, half are left in a vegetative state and the rest experience some sort of cognitive deficit depending on what part of the brain is affected. No one is left unscathed. Wearing a simple helmet can reduce the number of head injuries,” Dr Bhoi said.Apart from head trauma, the second most fatal is excessive bleeding. “Around 30% accident victims come in a haemorrhagic shock caused by excessive bleeding. This can be prevented by using a tourniquet. Tying a piece of cloth tightly above the area that is bleeding can reduce the blood flow,” Dr Bhoi said.How to reduce mortalityThe best way to reduce mortality is to reduce the number of accidents, the experts say. For this, there is a need to plan cities better and to improve road infrastructure.“The first step is to ensure that there are no potholes, and there are appropriate speed breakers and signage. And, the authorities should be on the lookout for and fix black spots or areas where a lot of accidents are reported. The pavements need to be improved and the roads have to be made keeping in mind the pedestrians,” said Dr Nutan Mehta, head of the new emergency and trauma wing of Dr Ram Manohar Lohia hospital.Then comes following speed limits taking safety measures such as wearing helmets and putting on seat belts.A study at the AIIMS trauma centre found that only half of the two-wheeler users were wearing helmets, only 45% had fastened it properly, and only 38.5% were wearing a helmet approved as “crash proof” by the Bureau of Indian Standards.Only 32.4% people used seat belts, showed another study from AIIMS. This is because of lax enforcement, which is the key to ensure safe driving practices.“World over, there is enough evidence to suggest that awareness alone cannot ensure safe driving practices. There is a need for strict enforcement so that people face real consequences like licences being cancelled and actually not being able to drive after the licence is cancelled. But, we do not have enough manpower to ensure that all violators get punished,” Dr Dandona said.Poor vehicular standards are also to blame. “Most of the commonly used cars in India do not adhere to the international safety standards. The New Car Assessment Programme (NCAP), which looks at how likely a driver or passenger is of surviving a crash, shows that there are only two or three cars that have a four-star rating, a norm strictly followed in the West,” Dr Bhoi said. And, even if there is a crash, to ensure that a person survives there is a need for a strong pre-hospital and hospital care.“Currently, there aren’t enough trauma care hospitals in the country, which means valuable time is lost and the patient does not get appropriate care within the first “golden” hour of the crash when the chances of survival and minimum disability is the highest. The roads are such that it is also difficult for ambulance to reach an accident site and then take the patient to the hospital in time,” said Dr Dandona.People at riskPeople walking on the roads and those driving two-wheelers have the highest risk of severe injury in road crashes. In India, 40% of all road crash deaths were reported in motorised two and three-wheeler riders and 10% in pedestrians.“In India as in any developing countries, higher number of injuries and deaths are reported in two wheeler riders and pedestrians because of the traffic mix. We have high speed cars moving along with bikes, cycles and pedestrians on the roads. This is because missing or occupied pavements and cycles lanes and the attitude of the people as well,” Dr Dandona said.Also, men outnumber women when it comes to road crashes.A study of demographics of the victims of road crash in Delhi showed that 84% were men and just 16% were women. Besides, almost 50% of the victims belonged to the 16-30 age group.“These are the groups that are more likely to travel for work. The way we have developed the infrastructure of the city, people have to travel long distances to get to work. There are commercial hubs and residential hubs in Delhi. Ideally, people should be working in their neighbourhood. If that were the case, 90% of the people would be off roads in the city,” said Dr Mehta of RML hospital.People in a hurry also lead to a higher number of crashes. Of the 900 accident victims interviewed for a 2017 study, 54.2% reported that they were in a hurry to reach somewhere. The same study reported that 26.1% were having a conversation with co-rider or on a cell phone. Drivers using mobile phones are 4 times more likely to be involved in a crash, according to the World Health Organisation.",0

The IAF is now left with 48 Mirage 2000 fighters.Smoke billows from the wreckage of a Mirage 2000 aircraft which crashed in Bengaluru Friday morning.(ANI)Two pilots of the Indian Air Force (IAF) were killed on Friday after their Mirage 2000 fighter jet crashed during takeoff at the Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) airport here.The French-origin trainer aircraft, manufactured by Dassault Aviation, was on an acceptance sortie after being upgraded at HAL, an IAF spokesperson said in New Delhi. IAF has ordered a probe into the accident that comes four days after a Jaguar aircraft went down in Kushinagar, Uttar Pradesh.First inducted into IAF in 1984, Friday’s crash was the 11th accident involving the Mirage 2000 fleet. The IAF is now left with 48 Mirage 2000 fighters.HAL identified the two pilots as squadron leaders Samir Abrol and Siddartha Negi.Commissioned into IAF in June 2008, Abrol, 33, was from Ghaziabad. Negi, 31, hailed from Dehradun and joined IAF in June 2009.“HAL regrets to inform that one upgraded Mirage 2000 aircraft crashed during the customer acceptance flight at HAL airport here today [Friday] around 10.30 am,” the state-owned plane maker said in a statement.Officials said that the pilots had ejected from the plane but landed on its wreckage.Minutes after the crash, residents from nearby areas posted videos and images of the accident site on social media. The flight data recorder has been recovered from the site.India had in 2011 signed a $2.4-billion contract with Dassault Aviation and Thales to upgrade 51 Mirage 2000 fighters with new weapons, radars and avionics. The first two aircraft were upgraded by the firms in France followed by another two at HAL in Bengaluru. HAL is upgrading the remaining planes.The fighter that crashed was upgraded at HAL, said an official who did not want to be identified.The crash couldn’t have come at a worse time for HAL, as questions have been raised about the capabilities of the state-owned company that is going through financial trouble.Several HAL projects are running years behind schedule, including the Mirage 2000 upgrade programme, much to IAF’s dismay.The Mirage 2000 upgrade is five years behind schedule.IAF’s efforts to support HAL have affected its fighting capabilities, air force chief Air Chief Marshal BS Dhanoa said on Thursday. Speaking at a conference at the Centre for Air Power Studies in New Delhi, he was responding to criticism about IAF’s alleged dislike for the HAL-made Tejas light combat aircraft.Since Independence, 17 test pilots and engineers have lost their lives in air accidents during the testing and evaluation of indigenous planes such as Marut, Kiran, Ajeet, Saras and AWACS (airborne warning and control systems) prototype aircraft.",0

999,"Two striking examples of BMC inefficiency in 1 dayThis week, the newly restored Flora Fountain developed a leak within a couple of days of its inauguration and a short distance away large chunk of Marine Drive caved inThis week, Mumbai woke up to two fine examples of how well the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) runs the city. The newly restored fountain at Hutatma Chowk developed a leak within a couple of days of its inauguration. And a short distance away, a fairly large chunk of Marine Drive, Mumbai’s most famous and iconic promenade, caved in near the crossing where this road turns towards Churchgate station.The general understanding in Mumbai is that no matter what happens elsewhere, Marine Drive is among those areas — Malabar Hill, Breach Candy, Peddar Road, Carmichael Road, Altamount Road, Napean Sea Road being some others — that are very well looked after.The crème de la crème of Mumbai resides in these areas as well as the most powerful, among them leading politicians, bureaucrats, BMC officials and police chiefs. Maintaining these areas hassle-free is not a new development. It has been so historically.Among these, Marine Drive enjoys prime of place. This is the road that gives the city so much of its aesthetic beauty, glamour and character, starting from the outer edge of Girgaum Chowpatty and leading up to the southern end where the Gateway of India stands, taking in its sweep Nariman Point and Mantralaya, where the state’s seat of power is located.How could anything go wrong on this road one might ask? Well, what excellent evidence to the contrary. Or perhaps this is democracy at work, where every area is treated equally badly!And as for Flora Fountain’s short-lived rejuvenation, it makes it easier to understand why we have pipes that don’t take water where most badly needed and waste it elsewhere.If these mishaps were not so serious, it would be almost comical. That this should happen in the country’s leading city, in prime locations and both of them so close to the BMC headquarters, is the deep irony. What hope then for other, less prominent areas?The Marine Drive cave-in was fortunately anticipated in the nick of time, preventing accidents and casualties. What if one or a couple of cars were travelling over the part where the road caved in, it could have led to a monumental tragedy.Flora Fountain’s malfunction was not a threat to life, but was a setback nonetheless and stymied months of effort at reviving one of the city’s major landmarks.It becomes particularly galling when you consider that the BMC is the richest civic body in the country. Its annual budget is in excess of ?27,000 crore, so resources for development, maintenance and repairs can hardly be the issue.Why then should such things occur — or recur — considering that there had been a cave-in on Marine Drive a few years earlier too?The problem lies in the lack of proper planning and detailing of such work that is undertaken – as seems to be the case in the Marine Drive road collapse, as well as callous disregard for completing the ‘last mile’ diligently, as the Flora Fountain setback highlights.Authorities associated with both these projects have been at pains to highlight what has gone wrong. But their explanations don’t wash because all these should have been factored in, leaving zero scope for the trouble that has been witnessed.Accidents can happen and always come unannounced. It is the preparedness for such eventualities that matters.This is where the civic body has been utterly incompetent, for there have been several instances in the past where this has showed up.A diatribe against the BMC, however, is not the purpose of this column, nor is that of much help. A great deal has already been written about the efficiency or otherwise of the corporation. More words will be wasted.Whether the corporation will wake up now, after the recent problems is moot.The more pertinent question is whether citizens will wake up, say enough is enough, and demand stringent accountability.",0
1000,"Two, 3-wheeler riders worst hit: WHOThe actual number of deaths, however, could be higher as per the report, which estimates that there were 2.99 lakh traffic fatalities. This means, an estimated 22.6 people per 100,000 population died of traffic accidents in India in 2016.Two and three-wheeler riders accounted for 40% of all traffic deaths in India in 2016, according to WHO’s Global Status Report on Road Safety 2018, which puts the total traffic deaths at 1.5 lakh that year.The actual number of deaths, however, could be higher as per the report, which estimates that there were 2.99 lakh traffic fatalities. This means, an estimated 22.6 people per 100,000 population died of traffic accidents in India in 2016.“The highest number of casualties are reported among people on two and three wheelers, and let me add pedestrians, because they do not have a protective exterior exposing them to more injuries. Also, the kind of speed and traffic mix in India means that cars with higher speed limits drive on the same road with two-wheelers with lower speed limit, making them more accident prone,” said Dr Rakhi Dandona who heads the Global Burden of Disease –Road Injuries group for the State-level Disease Burden initiative.Globally, 1.35 million people died in traffic crashes the same year.“The report shows that progress has been achieved in important areas such as legislation, vehicle standards and improving access to post-crash care. This progress has not, however, occurred at a pace fast enough. At this rate, the Sustainable Development Goal to halve road traffic deaths by 2020 will not be met,” the report stated.The estimated number of traffic fatalities is almost double, according to the World Health Organisation Report, which puts the absolute number of deaths at 2.99 lakhs. In 2016, 22.6 people in every 100,000 population died in traffic crashes.After two and three-wheeler, the highest number of deaths were reported in passengers of cars (12%), drivers and passengers of heavy trucks (11%), and pedestrians (10%) after deaths in two and three wheeler drivers.Looking at the factors leading to fatalities, the report found that India meets “two to six” international vehicle safety standards. The limit on blood alcohol concentration as per the law in India is 0.03 g/dl. Reducing blood alcohol concentrations from 0.1 g/dl to 0.05 g/dl may contribute to reduction in alcohol related road traffic fatalities by 6 - 18%, the report states.However, the maximum speed limit on urban and rural roads in India is 100 kmph. This is much higher than the speed of 50 kmph or less the report was looking at. “A 5% reduction in speed can reduce the number of fatalities by 30%,” it said.“There is a need to take a multi-sectoral approach to tackle road crashes and deaths. There has to better infrastructure that allows for safer travel, better vehicles, improved intervention and enforcement of laws, and a health system that can take care of accident victims. We need to look at the problem from a health perspective. Why should it be under the ministry of road transport and highways?” said Dr Dandona.India is the fourth-largest vehicle producer in the world.",0
1001,"Two-year-old survives Audi-dumper crash in Delhi that killed his parents, grandmotherThree members of the Singhal family - Sumit Singhal, his wife Ruchi and his mother - were killed when a dumper truck overturned on their Audi car in in outer Delhi’s Rohini in the early hours of Wednesday.Passers-by look at the mangled remains of an Audi car which collided with a dumper at Rohini, in New Delhi, Wednesday, Feb. 20, 2019, killing three of the four occupants of the car. (PTI)When Sonu saw a dumper truck topple on top of an Audi in outer Delhi’s Rohini in the early hours of Wednesday, he didn’t believe that there would be any survivors in the car. An hour later though, he believes he witnessed a “miracle”.The three adult occupants of the car were crushed to death, but a two-year-old child was rescued with minor injuries. “Hundreds of us had gathered at the spot, but we were helpless. There was no way we could have pulled anyone out of the car. The truck and the soil it was carrying were too heavy for us,” said Sonu, who sleeps on the roadside and sells black salt on a cart.“We thought all inside the car were dead, but then, we heard the cries of a child and we were desperate to help the child,” Sonu said.According to Anurag (goes by a single name), a friend of the Singhal family that was involved in the mishap, a crane arrived about an hour later. The truck was removed and the car’s occupants were taken out of the mangled remains of the vehicle. “Only the child was alive. The others looked dead,” Anurag said.Anurag happened to be at the spot as he was among several residents from the neighbourhood in Rohini Sector 15 who were returning from a wedding in Gurugram. “We were in Gurugram to attend the wedding of the daughter of our former neighbour, Rajesh Goyal. The Singhal family was among the attendees,” Anurag said.Anurag reached the accident spot just moments after the mishap. “The child survived because he was sleeping on the rear seat. The car’s roof probably did not crush him,” Anurag said.The child’s parents, Sumit Singhal and Ruchi Singhal, got married over three years ago. They lived with Sumit’s parents and his younger sister in their five-storey home in Rohini Sector 15. The family had rented out some floors, and also had a thriving pulses processing unit in Bawana.Overloading menaceAs most of the soil being carried by the dumper had landed on the road and the Audi, police said they are not in a position to determine if the “offending vehicle” was overloaded.But investigators said it was possible that the dumper was overloaded. “The truck must have been going at a high speed, and the load it was carrying may have caused it to topple over,” a senior police officer said.According to data from the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways, the menace of overloading in goods vehicles has resulted in 817 mishaps and cost 141 lives in Delhi between 2015 and 2017.At the national level, overloading has been cited as the trigger for 1,94,153 mishaps and 67,349 deaths in the three years between 2015 and 2017. In that period, these mishaps accounted for anywhere between 11.9% and 15.4% of all accidents in India. In terms of deaths, overloading accounted for around 15% of all fatalities.Alok Kumar, joint commissioner of police (Delhi traffic police), said his personnel cannot prosecute goods vehicles for overloading. “We do not have the facility for weighing trucks and their goods because of which we cannot determine if they are overloaded,” the JCP said.",0

The STF busted the mass copying racket during the UP Board examination of physics paper.Police recovered Rs 12.50 lakh cash, solved answer sheets, fake identity cards of 12 invigilators, who were doing duty illegally. Besides, two pistols, 80 bullets, 16 mobile phones, 31 bank passbooks, four physics books, carbon papers and a SUV, from their possession.The STF arrested Yogendra Pal Singh, a school principal and centre superintendent, 12 fake invigilators including one from Haridwar, two solvers, one clerk and a teacher who was the mastermind behind the racket.The mass copying gang was operating at Janata Inter College, Muzaffarnagar and hired solvers from Delhi, Haryana and Uttarakhand were found taking the exam illegally, said police. According to STF, most of the invigilators were not regular teachers. They were hired by the centre superintendent to facilitate copying. These invigilators were teachers of physics, the subject for which the exam was on. This is a clear violation of exam rulebook that mandates that non subject teachers can only be made invigilator.SSP STF Abhishek Singh said as examination was being conducted under CCTV camera vigil and these invigilators were found dictating answer from outside the classroom. A team of STF led by Vimal Gautam along with DIoS Muzaffarnagar raided Janta Inter College and arrested many persons.Singh said after quizzing various people it came to light that one Intekab is the mastermind of the gang. After being interrogated, he revealed that he had large network of copying gang in bordering states of UP like Delhi, Haryana and Uttarakhand.“To help students pass the examination, the gang charges something between Rs 25,000 to Rs 55,000 from each student. Every year nearly 2000 students approach this gang to help them pass the examination. In return the gang makes about Rs 7-8 crore in exam,” SSP STF claimed.SSP, STF, said the teachers were caught solving the exam papers in the laboratory. They were using carbon papers to write multiple copies. They were dictating answers in such a way that CCTV cameras were unable to catch them.",0
